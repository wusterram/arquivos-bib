Abstract = {The first steps for introducing an ERP solution to a small or medium
   sized company are essential for implementation success or failure. In
   this paper a structured approach to ERP evaluation and selection is
   proposed. The developed roadmap for ERP selection combines quality
   management specific approaches to the mains authors' practical
   experience in the selection and implementation of business related
   software. This methodology is based on the ``keep it simple{''}
   principle whilestill addressing multiple relevant dimensions and
   criteria in the selection processit is mainly practice oriented focusing
   on the ease of adoption and use of SME's, its main target beingcompany
   representativesresponsible for leading the selection process.Empirical
   evidence form a mid-sized distribution company is provided in order to
   illustrate how the proposed approach is applied in practice. (C) 2014

Abstract = {The paper investigates corporate governance characteristics of the
   company with the implementation of the ERP system. In fact, the
   implementation of ERP systems in the enterprise helps the enterprises to
   establish an information system and the information system could product
   a lot of information flow in the enterprise. Corresponds to the nature
   of corporate governance, ERP systems may be related to corporate
   governance. Based on data of listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen
   stock markets which have implemented ERP system, it is found that a
   relatively low proportion of independent directors of companies are more
   willing to implement the ERP system; relatively high degree of
   concentration of ownership of state-owned companies are more willing to
   implement the ERP system, relatively small degree of non-state-owned
   holding companies are more willing to implement the ERP system;
   state-owned holding company in relation to non-state-owned holding
   companies are more willing to implement the ERP system. In conclusion,
   the enterprises which are appraised that corporate governance is
   relatively poor are more willing to implement the ERP system.},

Abstract = {How does the implementation of ERP solutions influence the financial
   performance of companies? Using data for 406 of companies from Romania,
   we assessed the impact of the implementation of ERP solutions on the
   profitability and productivity of companies. We performed this analysis
   using companies' financial data for the period between 1999 and 2000.
   The analysis of the influence of ERP implementation on the two
   indicators was carried out both from the perspective of users'
   perception and from the perspective of the evolution over time of these
   financial indicators. Our results revealed a limited impact of the
   implementation of ERP systems on profitability and productivity, in line
   with the expectations of managers.},

Abstract = {ERP implementations are complex undertakings. The purpose of the present
   paper is to demonstrate strategies how ERP implementation ideas and
   strategies together could help overcome failure ERP implementation in
   Chinese firms based on critical success factors. Factor research is
   valuable for advancing our understanding of ERP implementation success.
   This study investigates a critical success factors model leading to
   implementation success, which is included top manager support, project
   champion, external experts, education \& training, accuracy of data,
   project management, drawing from literature research, case research,
   experts-interview, questionnaire investigation. And the model is
   theoretically sound and can be helpful to provide better understanding
   about the success of ERP systems. At last this study provides ERP
   implementation strategies according to the critical success factors
   model.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the criticality of the `End-Users' factor to the
   success or failure of the ERP venture. This descriptive case highlights
   the ineffectiveness of the current approaches to ERP end-users'
   ``training and competency building{''}, that are commonly applied in ERP
   implementations. We propose as an alternative, a new structured approach
   that redefines the traditional role of ``ERP Training{''} from isolated
   implementation project activities concerned with introducing end-users
   to ``how to{''} use ERP applications to an integral part of a
   comprehensive ``knowledge \& change management{''} strategy that
   advocates a holistic life-cycle approach to managing ERP Critical
   Success Factors (CSF).
   The investigation benefits from the ``iceberg competency model{''}, the
   ``training management cycle{''}, and ``Kirk-Patrik's evaluation
   model{''} as the theoretical basis and context for drawing a comparison
   of the suitability and effectiveness of training approaches adopted in
   major ERP implementations in UAE. The proposed approach, which is built
   around `end-user characterization' as the main input into `competency
   building' is flexible enough to plug into standard ERP methodologies and
   may be projected throughout the ERP life-cycle. The end-users
   characterization and competency building approach (EUCCB) is expected to
   contribute to healthy levels of ERP usage and utilization that leads to
   positive business gains and return on investment.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, organizations all over the world have adopted
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. There has been little
   research at a global scale regarding the accounting benefits of adopting
   enterprise systems. Moreover, there are virtually no studies that
   examine in detail the relation between accounting benefits and ERP user
   satisfaction. Sutton (2006) addressed the need for empirical research on
   the impact of ERP in terms of accounting advantages and disadvantages.
   The principal aim of our study was to investigate the accounting
   benefits that the adoption of an ERP system by companies may entail in
   relation to ERP user satisfaction. This study explored the impact that
   the ERP system has had on accounting information and practice. This
   study also examined whether or not there are differences between
   accountants and IT professionals concerning how each group assesses ERP
   accounting benefits and ERP user satisfaction. The participants of this
   study comprised 175 accountants and 96 IT professionals from 193
   companies in Greece. The empirical evidence confirms a number of
   accounting benefits derived from ERP systems particularly for accounting
   process. No statistically significant differences were found between the
   perceptions of accountants and IT professionals concerning ERP
   accounting benefits. Furthermore, this research identifies factors
   related to accounting benefits and ERP cost which affect the level of
   ERP user satisfaction. The implications of these results for practice
   and research are explored. The findings of this study will be of value
   to any companies considering the inclusion of their accounting
   techniques and operations in an ERP system. Furthermore, the results of
   this study will provide stimulus for consequent research in the field in
   order to further examine and account for the accounting benefits that
   can occur from ERP system implementation as well as the effect of those
   benefits on ERP user satisfaction. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {This paper presents a step-wise approach toward ERP implementation
   success, since the success of ERP system is considered an important
   issue. This approach builds on ERP life cycle that contains five stages,
   namely: project preparation, technology selection, project formulation,
   implementation/development and deployment. Each stage involves key
   success factors (KSFs) that influence the ERP implementation success. To
   address the study objectives, a survey questionnaire was considered the
   most appropriate research method. It was sent to 74 companies that have
   been implementing ERP system for at least one year. The respondents were
   staff at management level, IT staff and users involved in the
   development and use of the ERP system. The survey received 248 responses
   from 740 quesitionnaires that were sent to the companies. A quantitative
   analysis was applied to identify the weighting of KSFs toward ERP
   implementation success. The ERP implementation success can be measured

   service quality, tactical impact and strategical impact. The weighting

Abstract = {Nowadays the traditional management approach has given its place to
   modern mentality. The traditional structured functionality has evolved
   into system understanding which concerns the whole of enterprise. System
   approach is used to solve the problems of the organization. The
   strategic weapons which are necessary to manage the organization as a
   whole, are ``information systems{''}. The critical points about rational
   management of organizations and obtainment competitive advantage are
   information and using of information. An enterprise solution on the
   basis of the software is needed to ensure the integrity of the
   organization and the integration between the elements. Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) whose development is based on 1960s, is a
   holistic software that is fairly valid in terms of organizations.
   Disadvantages of ERP has led organizations to search for different
   software. Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) emerges as solution
   partner in this sense. In the study, explaining the establishment holism
   in the organizations and ensuring integration in the focal point, ERP
   and EAI are analyzed in a comparative manner. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {Although cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are becoming
   popular, there are still firms that have yet to migrate to the cloud
   because of data confidentiality and data security concerns. Firms that
   plan to adopt cloud ERP systems are expected to first understand cloud
   ERP's data processing practices. This study proposes a case study method
   with a systematic content analysis of cloud ERP providers' data
   processing agreements. The study will explore the data disclosure, data
   security, data sub-processing, and data retention and deletion practices
   of cloud ERP providers. In addition, this study investigates the
   linguistic characteristics of cloud ERP providers' data processing
   agreements including readability, litigious language, and uncertainty
   language. The findings of this study can help organizations to have a
   better understanding of the data process practices of cloud ERP
   providers, as well as the shared responsibilities between cloud ERP
   providers and users in maintaining data security.},

Abstract = {This study identifies 16 critical success factors (CSFs) for
   implementing an ERP system and develops relevant hypotheses through an
   exhaustive literature review, one case study and experts' interview. A
   questionnaire survey was used to collect data, a total of 167
   questionnaires are returned. SPSS software is used to analyze the data
   and test the validity of the hypotheses, at the same time, compared and
   contrasted ERP practitioner's survey results with consultant's results.
   The statistical finding reveals that data accept all hypotheses and the
   major CSF for the ERP implementation is the ``top management support and
   involvement{''}. There are some differences found between consultant and
   practitioners in regard to 4 critical success factors, viz. ``the
   ability of project manager{''}, ``education and training{''},
   ``management of project scope{''}, ``attitude of personnel{''}.
   Moreover, the finding indicates that some more important CSF dose not
   belong to ERP system quality aspect, but ERP project scope aspect and
   organizational characteristics aspect. The guidance significance of
   experimental research conclusions to ERP is discussed.},

Abstract = {Another article on ERP Systems ... there has been written so many of
   them! Why should you bother with this one? What makes this article
   better than the others? It provides a novelty in a world of
   unpredictability, where immediate action and decisions must be taken in
   a company in a matter of minutes. In today's organizations, ERP Systems,
   support organizational activities and decisions based on the majority of
   data input. These systems were lately challenged by the management and
   financial accountants because the information they crucially needed were
   not given in real time. Because the known keys used to unlock the ERP
   Systems, such as Business Intelligence Systems and Spreadmarts could not
   fully satisfy them, a new, revolutionary information system appeared:
   ``Accounting Intelligence{''} (AccI). The aim of this research is to
   provide knowledge about this system, for those who daily use accounting
   information, in order to improve their time management and their
   periodically reports.},

Abstract = {SYNOPSIS: We provide evidence that enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems are potentially beneficial to firm decision-making but can also
   have unintended effects. The tax function is one of the largest
   consumers of data within a firm, with over 50 percent of time spent
   gathering tax data and less than 30 percent of time spent on strategic
   data analysis (PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 2015). Difficulties in
   getting high-quality, timely tax information could negatively impact a
   firm's tax compliance activities and leave few resources for tax
   planning. Following the absorptive capacity theory, we predict and find
   that ERP systems are associated with a greater degree of tax planning
   postadoption, resulting in lower tax burdens. However, we also note
   increased firm discretion in tax planning, resulting in a larger amount
   of aggressive tax positions. Practically, our findings have important
   implications for the use of ERP systems both within the tax function and
   across other decision-making areas.},

   the ERP II implementing option has been analyzed under different
   information conditions. The vendor of ERP II implementing options hides
   implementing evaluation level information under asymmetry information.
   It is a principal-agent problem having adverse selection. This paper
   designed that objective function is taken at the biggest mathematical
   expectation value of investment profit. The optimization control of
   state equation is taken at implementing control cost and evaluation
   level. Using maximal principle the found solution scheme of ERP II
   implementing options optimization controlling cost and evaluation level
   has been derived. Finally, the simulation experiment in ERP II
   implementing options was made. The analysis result of ERP II
   implementing options is verified.},

Abstract = {ERP systems have fundamentally re-shaped the way business data is
   collected, stored, disseminated and used throughout the world. However,
   the existing research in accounting has provided only relatively few
   empirical findings on the implications for management control when
   companies implement ERP systems as the technological platform.
   Especially scarce are the findings concerning the production phase,
   after implementation, when the information processes, related work
   practices and the new information contents can be seen as established.
   In this paper we explored and theorized the benefits, challenges and
   problems for management control when an ERP system is in use, four years
   after the implementation. Our findings also illustrate why and under
   what circumstances these challenges and benefits may exist. For a
   holistic view of the organization our findings, based on a qualitative
   case study, are constructed from the viewpoints of people at different
   levels and functions of the organization. Top management expected a new
   strategic control system, but due to the many challenges it ended up
   with merely financial accounting based control. At the operational
   level, serious challenges lead to inadequate usage of the ERP system.
   Management control produces the financial basic data and must contend
   with many practical problems caused by ERP implementation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a set of advanced systems for the
   efficient management of business organizations based on information
   technology. This paper uses an empirical investigation to survey the
   current situation and benefits of implementation of ERP systems by
   pharmaceutical manufacturers of Hainan province in China. It aims to
   decipher how ERP is currently used and the proportion of ERP
   implementation in China enterprises. The paper strives to find out
   whether it is feasible and effective to implement ERP at present. The
   paper examines the basic situation in Hainan based on the number of ERP
   modules being used, sources of ERP software, comparison among different
   economic type enterprises and different capital size enterprises. It
   measures the benefits gained by the pharmaceutical manufacturers from
   implementing ERP from 6 important aspects including but not limited to:
   internal mechanisms, profitability, financial stability, operational
   ability, growing ability, and information dealing ability. It derives
   important conclusions from the sample data on existing ERP systems
   implementation, and lists the lessons to be learned by other Hainan
   pharmaceutical manufacturers on factors affecting successful
   implementation of such systems.},

Abstract = {The development of the technologies and the evolution of automated
   processes in recent decades have made increasingly intensive the use of
   ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems by the companies. If at the
   beginning, they were used only by large corporations, they are nowadays
   used by more and more companies of different dimensions. The migration
   of the companies to the digital environment is increasingly significant
   in all the industries, and if the information is digital, it can be
   automated by ERP systems. The main effects and advantages of using the
   ERP systems are supposed to be: saving time, increasing the
   productivity, increasing the incomes, diminishing the expenses,
   redefining the business model, redefining the relationship with the
   customers, increasing the internal resources available in the company or
   increasing the competitive advantages, and so on. Taking into
   consideration the link between the use of ERP systems and the expected
   positive effects, many researchers have studied different assumptions.
   The purpose of this paperwork is to analyse the existent literature
   regarding the economic benefits of using the ERP systems. This paperwork
   is a review of the research articles published in the research magazines
   with a high impact factor.},

Abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems offer extensive benefits and
   facilities to the entire business. ERP systems help the company to share
   and transfer data and information across all function units inside and
   outside the company. Exchange of data and information between company
   departments contributes in many ways in order to achieve different
   objectives. Cloud computing is a modern approach to computing, that
   takes place over the internet and offers scalability, reliability,
   availability and low cost of computer resources. The implementation and
   operation of ERP systems over cloud offers great advantages and
   benefits, despite the difficulties and challenges encountered. The
   time-for-market speed dominates today's business agenda, including new
   products and the supply of new IT applications and platforms. The ERP
   Cloud solutions enable company management to access accurate real-time
   information to help them make faster and better decisions and ensure
   data accessibility, visibility and consistency. Moreover, Cloud ERP
   eliminates redundant processes and systems and dramatically reduces the
   costs of doing business.},

   implementation (Nicolaou, 2004; Nicolaou and Bajor, 2004; Jukic and

   We place our research in the context of emerging economies,
   characterized by a reduced level of accountability especially in the
   case of SMEs. In this paper we conduct an in-depth investigation of an
   ERP's implementation context and its effects within a Romanian company.
   Triangulated data from 2006 to 2011 was collected and the contingency
   theory was employed in order to analyze and explain the organizational
   context of the ERP implementation, the internal alignment and the
   effects on company's performance. The case reveals particular aspects of
   the ERP implementation related to the case of emerging economies,
   bringing evidence that once the managers' support is secured, the ERP
   might become the central alignment mechanism, supplementing the
   accounting and controlling functions. Also, by covering the period
   before and during the economic crisis in Romania, our case illustrates
   how the alignment between organizational elements evolves, in order to
   respond to the needs of the environment. The case contributes to a
   nascent literature on ERP effects in the context of emerging economies,
   and provides useful results for researchers, managers and IT employees.},

Abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution (IR4.0) has unfurled its wings over all
   industries, and its positive impact on the modern global economy has
   already emerged significantly. The need for a real-time, integrated
   information environment to enhance business operations has motivated
   companies to employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Once
   implemented, the organization's attention has shifted to the most
   efficient deployment of the ERP post-system usage. User acceptance of
   the ERP system during the post- implementation phase could determine the
   overall system's success or failure since the system benefits reside in
   the exploitation of the integration capabilities. This study aimed to
   investigate the determinants of user acceptance of post-ERP system usage
   in Malaysian organizations by adopting the UTAUT model. The five
   identified factors comprised of performance expectancy, effort
   expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and behavioural
   intention. The result suggests that these five factors have a
   significant positive influence on ERP acceptance among Malaysian ERP
   users. From a theoretical point of view, the findings open new doors of
   opportunities by providing new insights into the user's acceptance of
   ERP in the Malaysian environment. The practical contribution includes
   recommendations provided to organizations to emphasize the specific
   factors that increase the effectiveness of the ERP post-implementation
   phase.},

Abstract = {Successful implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
   has become a critical facilitator for efficient operations management in
   enterprises. Due to the ERP system implementations are managed via the
   project team, the effects of the centrifugal and centripetal forces
   (CCFs) on ERP implementation become an important research issue. The
   purpose of this paper is to identify the effects of the CCFs on
   successful ERP implementation and mentoring functions moderates the
   relationship between the CCFs and successful ERP implementation. Using
   survey data from 285 respondents collected from team members of ERP
   projects at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Taiwan, we
   found that centripetal forces had positive effects on successful ERP
   implementation and centrifugal forces had no significant positive
   effects on successful ERP implementation. In addition, mentoring
   functions had positive effects on successful ERP implementation and
   mentoring functions also had negatively moderating effects on the
   relationship between centrifugal forces and successful ERP
   implementation and mentoring functions had positively moderating effects
   on the relationship between centripetal forces and successful ERP
   implementation. Moreover, high mentoring functions had better influences
   on successful ERP implementation than low mentoring functions when
   centrifugal forces is low, but high mentoring functions had better
   influences on successful ERP implementation no matter what centripetal
   forces is low or high. Based on this research, we suggest that
   enterprises in implement ERP projects should effectively use mentoring
   functions to manipulate the CCFs to improve the effectiveness of ERP
   implementation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article research is to discuss about the topic of
   smart data with the help of an integrated Enterprise Resource Planning
   (ERP) system that can provide detailed reports for all the internal
   requirements of a company in the accounting field. These reports acquire
   the smart attributions necessary for the sustainable development of the
   activity carried out. Regarding the management objectives, the ERP
   system offers intelligent solutions about the detailed reporting and
   analysis. This smart data can be accessed in a real time manner if the
   human capital of the company is well trained to understand the data
   transmitted by the ERP system. In order to streamline the process of
   reporting and analyse the key data, it is recommended that before using
   and implementing an integrated ERP system, human capital represents the
   value added on the integrated system. In order to reach a maximum level
   of performance in the company, it is recommended that both staff and
   structural capital (ERP) work in close connection. A case study was
   made, based on the application of a questionnaire that allowed to
   measure the importance of switching from accounting software to an ERP
   system developed especially for the needs of the company. It has been
   applied in the financial-accounting departments within several
   companies. The respondents represent the employees with higher studies
   in the economic field. They assisted the transition from an accounting
   system to an ERP system in the company where they operate and noticed
   the beneficial differences of an ERP system. If this system influences
   the staff employed through actual working time, smart data from ERP
   improves the future perspective of the top management. Based on the
   obtained results, the efficiency of the working time and the improvement
   of other performance indicators regarding those future directives of the
   company were concluded.},

Abstract = {In this paper, decision-support benefits is introduced as a substitute
   variable to explain the relationship between the purpose of the
   implementation of ERP and enhancing decision-support benefits. We
   studied the importance of a variety of purposes to implement of ERP in
   organizations by questionnaires. The traditional ranking order of the
   purpose of implementation of RRP in China is basically the same as in
   other countries. However, other countries' ranking orders have changed
   greatly. We test the relationship between the purpose of the
   implementation of ERP and enhancing decision-support benefits and find
   the two are positively related, and that ERP can help enterprises to
   enhance the decision-support benefits. A number of standards for
   evaluation of ERP are established in our study. At the same time, the
   study of the purpose of implementation of ERP should catch more
   attention. These conclusions has certain significance to further
   research and practices in future.},

Title = {Integration as unrealised ideal of ERP systems: An exploration of
   complexity resulting from multiple variations of integration},
Journal = {QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-34},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to uncover how implementation practices affect
   the unfolding of integration as the ideal of an enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) system. In this way, the authors aim to provide a better
   understanding of the ways in which the ideal of integration affects the
   complexity of ERP systems.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper interprets a case study of the
   implementation of an ERP system in a Dutch company.
   Findings The paper highlights how different variations of an object of
   integration were enacted during an ERP implementation. The authors
   observe how the interests of the various actors were not always served
   by the variations of integration in circulation. They illustrate how
   this resulted in a failure of the network to be folded into a
   taken-for-granted configuration of constituent parts. Consequentially,
   having multiple variations of integration contributed to increased
   complexity of the system.
   Originality/value The paper highlights how multiple variations of a
   single object of integration are brought into circulation. Such
   perspective enables a better understanding of some of the complexities
   associated with ERP implementations.},

Abstract = {Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation is probably the
   most laborious and rather costly part of the ERP system life-cycle. The
   paper provides a percentage structure of total cost of implementation
   (TCI) from end-user company's perspective. It should be of interest to
   companies planning to implement ERP systems, since literature suggests
   that TO can be 3-5 times higher than the software license alone. TCI is,
   for purpose of this paper, split into the following four parts: software
   license, programming of changes, organizational implementation, and
   hardware costs. ERP systems used to be a domain of large companies but
   there is a still increasing number of small and middle enterprises
   (SMEs) adopting them as well. Based on research done in Slovenia and
   Slovakia, the impact of the different company size, the country,
   existence of formal information strategy, representation of the IT
   department on the board level, and turnover growth on individual parts
   of TCI is analyzed and findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Enterprise resource planning is an effective tool in achieving
   management goals. Cloud ERP systems and applications are
   platform-independent offerings of this management tool in a cloud
   environment. This study was carried out to make sense of the advantages,
   difficulties and relationships of the cloud ERP system with scientific
   studies. For this purpose, the Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar
   databases and the Publish or Perish, WOSviewer and Excel applications
   were used. Statistical analysis, text mining, word network association,
   visual mapping and trend analysis were performed. As a result of the
   analysis, it was found that the total rate of publications produced in
   the last 3 years was 43\%, the most cited work was Springer (20\%) and
   the country was the USA (10\%). It was determined that the three most
   frequently used keywords were `cloud ERP', `ERP system' and `ERP'. A
   strong correlation was found between `study' and `challenge' in text
   mining. The challenge was closely related to `SMEs', `data', `provider',
   `technology', `literature' and `cloud environment'. In recent studies,
   the concept of `cloud ERP implementation' in SMEs has come to the fore.},

Abstract = {Previously, ERP system is mainly implemented in large enterprises rather
   than small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In recent years, many
   SMEs start to implement ERP system in the context of globalization,
   intense competitions and the demand of continuous developments, however
   the implementation has met various kinds of dffficulties, the success
   rate is very low. Through literature review and a Chinese nation's SME
   case study, this paper found out four types of critical factors for ERP
   implementation in nation's SMEs, including exterior circumstance factor,
   interior management factor, personnel factor and technique support
   factor.},

Title = {Reconstructing legitimacy of internal auditing during ERP
   implementations: two contrasting cases},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING LITERATURE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 30},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to examine how the legitimacy of internal
   auditing is reconstructed during enterprise resource planning
   (ERP)-driven technological change.Design/methodology/approachThe study
   is based on the comparative analysis of internal auditing and its
   transformation due to ERP implementations at two case firms operating in
   the food sector in Egypt - one a major Egyptian multinational
   corporation (MNC) and the other a major domestic company
   (DC).FindingsInternal auditors (IAs) at MNC saw ERP implementation as an
   opportunity to reconstruct the legitimacy of internal auditing work by
   engaging and partnering with actors involved with the ERP change. In
   doing so, the IAs acquired system certifications and provided line
   functions and external auditors with data-driven business insights. The
   ``practical coping mechanism{''} adopted by the IAs led to the
   acceptance (and legitimacy) of their work. In contrast, IAs at DC
   adopted a purposeful strategy of disengaging, blaming and rejecting
   since they were skeptical of the top management team's (TMT's)
   sincerity. The ``disinterestedness{''} led to the loss of legitimacy in
   the eyes of the stakeholders.Originality/valueThe article offers two
   contributions. First, it extends the literature by highlighting a
   spectrum of behavior displayed by IAs (coping with impending issues vs
   strategic purposefulness) during ERP-driven technological change.
   Second, the article contributes to the literature on legitimacy by
   highlighting four intertwined micro-processes - participating,
   socializing, learning and role-forging - that contribute to
   reconstructing the legitimacy of internal auditing.},

Abstract = {After China joined the WTO, the Chinese manufacturing enterprises had to
   face much more pressure. Information technology and information systems
   become an indispensable tool to improve the competitiveness of
   organizations. At the same time, they played more and more major roles
   in the organizations. More and more enterprises attempt to improve their
   management and expand the market though the ERP. This paper gives a
   typical case of a chemical fiber company that is about implementation of
   the ERP. As a result of implementing the ERP, the company became one of
   the 500 strong information-based enterprises in China in 2003, and the
   company attained this glory again in 2004. Furthermore the company also
   gained the title of advanced information-based enterprise of the
   chemical fiber industry in January, 2003. In the paper, we summarize the
   way to implement the ERP and the successful experience. It will set a
   good example for other companies to carry on the ERP and impel the
   information-based progress of the chemical fiber industry.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate the changes caused by the use of the
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in the accounting of
   organizations at different levels: organizational structure; processes;
   and employees.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors use a qualitative methodology with interpretative analysis
   through the study of five cases in Portuguese companies that implemented
   the Sage ERP X3. The data collection was carried out mainly through
   semi-structured interviews.
   Findings
   The results indicate that the successful implementation of the ERP
   system is associated with changes in the organizational structure,
   reengineering of processes and changes in the functions of employees.
   These changes interact and cause modifications among themselves, which
   makes it difficult to identify the origin and sequence of changes
   related to the implementation of the systems. It was possible to
   identify the direct impact of the ERP system on the change of processes,
   which is reflected in the functions of the employees, as well as to
   verify that the ERP system provides the opportunity for companies to
   change their organizational structure.
   Originality/value
   This paper contributes to the accounting literature by providing
   evidence on the influence of ERP systems on organizational aspects of
   accounting in the Portuguese reality, attesting that the successful
   implementation of the ERP system is associated with changes in the
   organizational structure, reengineering of processes and changes in the
   functions of employees.},

Title = {Examine ERP post-implementation stages of use and value: Empirical
   evidence from Portuguese SMEs},

Abstract = {There is a great interest among researchers and practitioners in
   accounting information systems (AIS) value. This is particularly
   important in cases of systems such as enterprise resource planning
   (ERP). This paper empirically measures and analyses the determinants of
   ERP use and value in a single framework, as well as provides empirical
   evidence from Portuguese small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Drawing
   upon theories on the process and contexts of information technology (IT)
   we postulate nine hypotheses. Used the
   technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to hypothesize how
   compatibility, complexity, efficiency, best-practices, training, and
   competitive pressure explain ERP use. Based on the resource-based view
   (RBV) theory we hypothesize how ERP use, collaboration and analytics
   explain ERP value, and its potential contribution for the nature of
   management control and accounting information systems on Portuguese
   SMEs. Through structural equation modeling, a data set of 134
   web-surveyed firms is used to test the hypotheses. Our empirical
   analysis leads to six main findings: 1) compatibility, complexity,
   best-practices, and efficiency are more important determinants for ERP
   use as well as training and competitive pressure, suggesting that
   technological, organizational and environmental characteristics are the
   main drivers of ERP use among Portuguese SMEs. 2) Similarly,
   collaboration and analytics are more important for ERP value upon use,
   suggesting that system capability characteristics are the main drivers
   of ERP value. 3) ERP value benefits from system enhancements to firms'
   business processes in the post-implementation phases. 4) For Portuguese
   SMEs the mostly valued metric attained through ERP is management
   control. 5) Impelled by legislation, Portuguese SMEs are using ERP as
   the accounting system for management, financial and tax accounting. 6)
   Portuguese SMEs invest more than 70\% of their annual IT budget to ERP
   use. Together, these findings offer insights into how Portuguese SMEs
   use and extract value from ERP, and how enhancements positively impact
   the system's value. Unlike the typical focus on ERP adoption described
   in the literature, this research focuses on the post-implementation
   phase, linking actual use with value creation, adding an empirical study
   to the AIS literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article shows the importance of the ecological and integrated
   reporting for any company with the help of an integrated ERP system.
   Only with the support of human capital, it is possible to use properly
   the system. We chose this type of integrated system because it offers
   the possibility of an electronic archive and can also generate reports
   of any form (PDF, EXCEL, etc.). The research objectives were to
   demonstrate the efficiency of an ERP system for an integrated and
   ecological reporting, as well as, the efficiency of its use for a
   maximum of performance at company and employee level. Printing documents
   generates certain costs and it is also a waste of time at the employee
   level (for organizing documents). The ERP system offers the possibility
   to have access to any type of report (whether it is generated by the
   employees or company managers). In some cases, in order to perform
   certain operations, or to generate a situation, a user will need the
   consent of a superior to perform the task. In the case of a global
   pandemic, this type of both financial and integrated reporting is the
   most efficient and secure way to fully maintain administrative activity.
   Of course, in order to be able to carry out these operations, any
   society needs well-trained human capital. To present better the
   importance of an ecological integrated reporting, and to protect the
   environment, we conducted a quantitative research, using the
   questionnaire as a measurement tool. This study confirmed all the
   mentioned aspects.},

Abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), a theory of advanced management,
   raised on the condition of high western industrialization, strengthens
   planned management which takes time as masterstroke. But, for Chinese
   enterprises with low industrialization and immature management, merely
   consolidating time management is far from sufficient. In this paper, we
   put forward a framework of ERP system with three control from
   Time-Cost-Innovation, in which cost control and innovation management
   are fused, and carry out an empirical study by International
   Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) database.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate the impact of integrating
   Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP) systems and lean
   manufacturing (LM) practices on sustainability performance, especially
   in Egypt as an emerging country. Design/methodology/approach The authors
   carried out an experimental study with a sample of 144 professional
   accountants of MPA, MBA and DBA students at two of the top universities
   in Egypt. Findings The results provide significant evidence that the
   integration of S-ERP systems and LM practices implementation improve
   sustainability performance. However, there is no significant evidence
   that S-ERP adoption contributes to the success of LM practices
   implementation. Research limitations/implications Because of the chosen
   research approach, this study is limited to use of a laboratory
   experiment design. Empirical evidence based on quasi experiments on a
   field setting would add value to the current literature. Practical
   implications Findings provide practical insights for the manufacturing
   sector managers into the benefits of integrating S-ERP systems and LM
   practices for sustainability performance improvement (e.g. reducing cost
   and waste, increasing operational efficiency). For ERP vendors, findings
   highlight how ERP vendors introduce ``enablers{''} that incorporate LM
   best practices into their ERP systems and also how those vendors conform
   to the software sustainability criteria in the design of ERP
   applications. Originality/value Contrary to previous studies that
   addressed the individual impact of S-ERP systems and LM practices on
   performance, this paper experimentally gives an indication of the impact
   of concurrent implementation of S-ERP and LM practices on sustainability
   performance, especially in developing countries.},

Abstract = {The model of BOM (Bill of Material) in ERP consists of structural and
   quantitative models. In coal industry, A BOM structural model decides
   the kinds of material consumed by product (raw coal), while a BOM
   quantitative model ascertains the quantity of material consumed in the
   process of production. The arrangement of the former is relatively
   simple, but the latter is quite complicated because the materials don't
   constitute the product (raw coal). Therefore, the key to successful
   implement of coal industry ERP is how to decide a quantitative model of
   BOM reasonably and accurately. However, systematic studies on the BOM
   quantitative model of ERP in the coal industry have seldom been seen.
   Based on those, the author's endeavor in this paper is to explore an
   approach to ascertain the quantity of materials consumed in the process
   of mining coal in order to establish a complete model of BOM for the
   coal industry ERP.
   This paper begins by analyzing the characteristics of materials
   consumption and the factors effecting materials to be consumed in the
   coal industry. Secondly, the BP artificial neural network (ANN) is
   chosen and its algorithm is improved for establishing the quantitative
   model of BOM in coal industry ERP; A example is designed to prove the
   quantitative model of ANN-based BOM to be suitable for ascertain the
   quantity of materials consumption in the coal industry. Finally,
   Comparing of target value (TV) and predicting value (PV) of validation
   samples, the conclusion is arrived at that the quantitative model of
   ANN-based BOM improves the quality of material management and helps ERP
   to be implemented successfully in the coal industry.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors present their solutions on the adaptation
   of an ERP Production module dedicated to assembly lines, with the aim of
   meeting specific requirements in the process industries (chemical,
   cosmetics, food, pharmaceutics, etc.). Their ideas were validated based
   on top ERP solution implementation, using its utilities and software
   modules. There are represented certain elements to the execution of the
   Production module and also the specific requirements in process
   industry, from a beneficiary point of view. The Microsoft Dynamics NAY
   solution meets the requirements of the packaging phase, requiring a few
   customizations for the characteristics of production activities and
   explicit developments related to the process industry. As future
   developments in the ERP modules, the authors propose in this paper a
   connection with the Process Control Systems (PCS), highlighting several
   advantages. The latter record both technological information and
   business information (information on the consumption of raw materials,
   packaging, completed production etc.) by monitoring the data generated
   by production automation equipment, such as: electronic flow meters,
   electronic scales, sensors and transducers, digital countdown and other
   specialized devices. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Existing studies have found a linkage between institutional factors and
   systems adoption, but the literature has overlooked an important
   question: When is the decision to implement a system influenced by
   institutional factors? In this paper, the author argues that decisions
   to adopt systems are not influenced equally by institutional factors,
   and examines how system characteristics moderate the effects of
   institutional factors on adoption decisions, specifically decisions to
   adopt enterprise resource planning (hereafter, ERP) systems. The results
   of the study reveal that institutional factors, such as mimicry of
   peers, compliance with industry norms, and coercion from powerful
   entities influence ERP adoption decisions. The results also show that
   the effects of institutional factors on adoption decisions are amplified
   when participants have not already adopted an ERP system, the benefits
   of the system are difficult to quantify, and the system enhances
   organizational interaction throughout the supply chain. Through this
   paper, the author contributes to the institutional theory literature by
   exploring conditions that enhance the salience of institutional factors
   and contributes to accounting information systems literature by
   investigating the boundaries of the influence of institutional factors
   on ERP adoption.},

Abstract = {The progress of the digitalization of the industry has motivated
   companies to increase investments in solutions and tools that allow the
   automation of processes so that they can develop and improve their
   performance. The impact of the digitalization concept on the business
   has become a very special topic for most companies that want to automate
   their processes and to have a sustainable business. The progress of the
   economic and IT environment has led to the emergence of digital
   transformation, which has an impact on the expectations and behaviour of
   companies.
   The aim of this paper is to observe the impact of digitalization and
   industry 4.0 on business, and particularly whether ERP systems are a
   solution for business.
   The research method used was the systematic review of the literature.
   The selected articles aim at defining the concepts of digitization and
   industry 4.0, the advantages and disadvantages of industry 4.0, but also
   at demonstrating that ERP systems are the best solution for process
   automation for companies.
   The results showed that digitalization and industry 4.0 have a positive
   impact on the performance and sustainability of companies if they
   implement an ERP system within the company. In conclusion, ERP systems
   have a beneficial role for a company.},

Title = {Role of ERP systems in management accounting in SMEs in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 13},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to explore the role of successfully implemented
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems by investigating changes in
   management accounting (MA) and the influence of the context of small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the adoption and implementation
   process in an emerging market economy, namely, Saudi
   Arabia.Design/methodology/approachA case-study approach was used to
   review and compare the ERP adoption and implementation process in two
   Saudi SMEs from different industries for the descriptive analysis and
   assessment of changes in MA following the adoption of the system and
   influence of context. Secondary data were analyzed, and semi-structured
   interviews were conducted to collect data.FindingsThe results indicate
   that successful ERP implementations support and unify the core business
   processes and functions and improve analysis, decision-making, reporting
   and the overall quality of data. Furthermore, the results show that a
   management accountant's role is widened and shifted from a mere
   information provider to a business advisor and analyst, enhancing
   management accounting techniques. The results confirm that ERP
   implementation is related to the SMEs' technological, organizational and
   environmental contexts, which must be fully understood to achieve the
   desired improvements in the management accounting
   system.Originality/valueThis study contributes to understanding how ERP
   systems impact MA and management accountants, particularly in SMEs from
   developing countries, namely, Saudi Arabia. Specifically, to the best of
   the author's knowledge, this study is one of the first to use the
   technology-organization-environment framework and contingency theory to
   investigate post-ERP implementation changes in SMEs MA in an emerging
   market economy.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the influence of sustainable
   enterprise resource planning (S-ERPs) systems implementation on
   sustainability performance.Design/methodology/approachA 1 x 2 experiment
   was conducted, involving a sample of 72 professional accountants
   enrolled in MPA, MBA and DBA programs at two prominent Egyptian
   universities. Simple linear regression was used to analyze the
   data.FindingsThe results reveal positive relationships between the
   implementation of S-ERPs and economic, environmental and social
   sustainability performance.Research limitations/implicationsConsidering
   the research methodology used, which relies on a laboratory experiment
   design; nevertheless, empirical data derived from a quasi-experiment
   conducted in a real-world context would offer valuable insights into the
   existing literature.Practical implicationsFor manufacturing sector
   managers, the results offer value as organizations can benefit from
   S-ERP adoption in the internal and external integration of
   sustainability functions. The findings also provide decision-makers in
   the manufacturing context, particularly in emerging countries, with
   tangible reasons to consider S-ERP adoption for holistic sustainability
   benefits including waste management, resource consumption reduction and
   management of sustainable supply chain complexities. Further, the
   findings provide valuable insights for ERP vendors on how they can
   develop their ERP packages to align with software sustainability
   criteria.Originality/valueThis study is among the few that
   experimentally investigates the influence of S-ERPs implementation on
   sustainability performance within the manufacturing sector, especially
   in an emerging context such as Egypt. This unique contribution provides
   valuable insights into the complex connection between technology
   adoption and sustainability outcomes.},

Abstract = {In the 21st century, the world has entered the era of supply chain.
   Competition among enterprises has been transforming into creating and
   utilizing the supply chain in ways of being safer, more efficient, more
   stable with low-cost. The engagement process of the financing service by
   commercial banks requires up- and downstream trade information about the
   core enterprise, provided by their supply chains. However, some of the
   processes still rely on a lot of human efforts. ERP system has
   integrated logistics and information flow. By docking electronic banking
   systems to the ERP system, the logistics, information flow and cash flow
   can be unified comprehensively. Based on the SAP system, this article
   optimizes three main business scenarios in the traditional supply chain
   financing services, supply chain management, trade and finance
   management, and settlement management. It provides an idea of connecting
   ERP with electronic banking systems to help commercial banks to obtain a
   more comprehensive supply chain information, hence being conducive to
   the promotion and development of the electronic supply chain finance
   business.},

Abstract = {Based on a careful considering of all factors that affect the selection
   of ERP software, an evaluation index system is built. Further more, by
   integrating the entropy approach and the fuzzy evaluation approach, an
   evaluation approach called the Entropy-fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation Model
   is put forward. It combines the objectivity of the entropy approach and
   fuzziness of the fuzzy evaluation approach, thus can determine the
   weights of each evaluation factors by their inherent information of the
   evaluation factors themselves to keep the weight's impersonality; on the
   other hand, by quantifying and synthesizing inherent information of each
   evaluation factor and subjective information of decision-makers'
   experience and judgment, we can obtain a combined weight, which
   eliminates the defects of the entropy approach. This evaluation model
   also makes it easier for the determination of subjection degree, and the
   final evaluation result is more reliable. At the end of this paper, an
   example is given to show the feasibility of the proposed model.},

Abstract = {Due to the intensive competition, the implementation of a good IT
   (information technology) tool can help to improve the competence of the
   small and medium enterprise (SME). Under such an emerging paradigm of
   IT-based business management, to establish an effective and efficient
   management information system (MIS) becomes a popular trend for SMEs all
   over the world. Among those various information systems, ERP (enterprise
   resource planning) is recognized as one the most useful tools for
   businesses today. This article will share an enterprise's experiences in
   systematically implementing an ERP system in Taiwan. In this empirical
   project, the case company conducted an industry-academic cooperation on
   BPR+QMS for ERP implementation. During the First stage of this project,
   case company's overall operation activities were reviewed and processes
   within individual department /among different departments were
   re-designed. At the Second stage, some ERP software solutions were
   evaluated under some criteria (functions, cost, implementation
   schedule.., and so on) decided by industry-academic work force team. A
   full-function ERP software was chosen for case company's daily
   operations. At the Third stage, following with those above two main
   tasks, our project applied the designed structure of ISO 9001:2008 QMS
   to establish a quality management system (QMS) to help the
   implementation and future maintenance of its ERP system. From this
   empirical case, such a BPR-QMS-ERP project helped case company became a
   full-ERP-functioned company with sales/ distribution/ research \&
   development/ production/ procurement/ human resource activities, and
   some helpful operational procedures were developed to guide those daily
   tasks. From BPR to standard operational procedures' establishment,
   experience gathering from this empirical case may be served as an
   effective and efficient practice to introduce and implement IT tool for
   business.},

Abstract = {Previous research on ERP systems (EPRSs) shows that the risk of failure
   is very important. Also, the difficulties in implementing an ERPS in a
   transition economy are different from the ones encountered in a
   developed country (Huang and Palvia, 2001; Roztocki and Weistroffer,
   2008). Our research relies on the presentation of a case study developed
   in a Romanian company implementing an ERPS. Based on the literature
   review, we define the phases of the implementation process (Markus and
   Tanis, 2000; Parr and Shanks, 2000; Ross and Vitale, 2000; Somers and
   Nelson, 2004). In the literature review section we present as well the
   difficulties encountered by a company implementing an ERPS in a
   transition and in a developed economy in a comparative form. Our paper
   will continue with the presentation of the difficulties encountered in
   our case company. The implementation started in 2013 and difficulties
   related to financing, IT infrastructure, employees, management etc. were
   identified. We present the difficulties on specific implementation
   phases. Both authors were actively involved in the implementation
   process, which makes this paper an action research.},

Abstract = {Hotel management systems are designed to facilitate working routines and
   improve the fluency and efficiency of operations in hotels and other
   accommodation providers. Hotel organizational structures are known for
   their complexity, therefore communication and information flow between
   separate functional departments, i.e. front office, accounting,
   convention, F\& B and sales, is a key factor to proper and continual
   account management, resource planning and mainly guest satisfaction.
   This complexity is projected into current set-up of information system.
   Frequently, hotels are using several specialized systems for different
   departments. This fact impacts on reliability, accuracy and availability
   of information inside the hotel. Finding the best fit for the use of
   various technologies in this highly competitive industry is critical
   also because interpreting customer needs and forecasting market trends
   is so important. The aim of this article is to uncover informational
   linkages between the relatively independent departments and information
   systems and to ascertain the perception of HMS users within Czech
   hotels. To answer the proposed questions the paper uses questionnaire
   research methodology combined with interviews on sites. To complement
   the picture of the use of ERP systems in the industry the perceived
   quality of internal information system and easiness to use information
   from external environment having impact on the service is also assessed},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to detail how the adoption of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems creates major distortions in
   the corporate decision-making process.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach is to focus on the distortion
   in the capital budgeting process of corporations emanating from the
   rigidity of ERP software. The rigidity negatively influences
   decision-making because ERP software often dictates that the firm must
   change its core business procedures and processes to fit the software.
   Findings - Lack of flexibility limits the introduction of new products,
   or targeting a new customer segment by increasing costs and imposing
   delays in implementation.
   Research limitations/implications - Firms would benefit from performing
   detailed analysis of the impact of ERP systems on their ability to make
   operational decisions.
   Originality/value - This paper focuses on the problem of decreased
   flexibility in making changes in the production and accounting
   components of the firm when purchasing and installing ERP systems that
   cannot accommodate minor or major changes in the corporation.},

Abstract = {Production and logistical processes are some of the most critical
   processes in every industrial enterprise. Mastering these processes has
   a direct influence not only upon the entrepreneurial activities of
   individual firms, but also on the whole of the supplier-customer chain
   and on industrial branches as It whole. For this very reason, these
   processes have always been, are and will continue to be the centre of
   interest in the exploitation and use of modern information systems and
   technologies. ERP systems represent a key software infrastructure for
   production and logistics management. Their effective application in
   everyday working practice should however not take place without the use
   of the corresponding methods for the planning and management of
   production and logistics processes. This paper summarises the main
   observations of the Center for inVestigations into Information Systems
   (CVIS) in these fields, it provides an overview of the main results and
   outcomes of research study investigations into the Czech ERP market with
   an orientation on the planning and management methods integrated into
   the applications logic of ERP systems.},

Abstract = {The accounting activities environment, the business itself is changing
   daily, and the technologies are in constant change. The problem of
   adapting the KPI application, inside SAP ERP, is the starting point for
   this paper. Old application of KPI are moved to SAP using the latest
   technology from SAP Web Dynpro ABAP. The application was redesigned and
   developed in SAP (System and Applications, Products) environment. The
   development was done in the programming language ABAP (Advanced Business
   Application Programming) - using Web Dynpro technologies. In this paper
   is presented the new concept of collecting data from an ERP (invoices,
   orders, data from papers regarding fixed assets, etc.), use of these
   data in order to achieve the target regarding the activities in one
   accounting department (number of the data entered in one ERP system SAP)
   regarding tasks what where performed in one accounting month. The data
   will be automatically collected from SAP and presented according with
   designed KPI formulas developed by the management of the company. This
   application - module is used in a big oil and gas company. Aspects
   regarding the analysis, implementation and testing of the software
   application will be presented in this paper.},

Abstract = {With the increasing business globalization and worldwide marketing, ERP
   systems become more and more complex and some new requirements that
   focus on both reengineering of the business process and optimization of
   global resources configuration are brought forward. To address these
   problems, the architecture of ERP has been developed, in which the
   agents are classified into five types. In this architecture, the
   communication and information exchanges are realized between agents
   (based on KQML and CORBA). Finally, to illustrate the architecture, an
   experiment system has been proposed in detail. The objective of this
   paper is to illustrate the architecture of ERP systems based on agent
   and mediator with the purposes of extensibility, flexibility to achieve
   the business agility, reusability of the component, and cooperation
   between application systems to assure a global optimization.},

Abstract = {There is need to study the influences SME context within ERP
   implementation. The reason is that for an efficient ERP implementation
   process to occur in a business, one must have the requisite knowledge of
   the influences that may positively or negatively affect the process. The
   paper conducts the investigation on the influences of the SME context on
   ERP implementation by incorporating scholarly works and providing
   conclusions in a logical manner. The investigation finds that the
   implementation of ERP in the SME context is influenced by the
   availability of human and financial resources, the ownership type of the
   business, structure, culture, business procedures, and processes, and
   the stage of the business' growth. The investigation also finds that
   other influences include market and customers as well as uncertainty.
   Lastly, it concludes that IT knowledge, expertise, function and
   complexity also influence ERP implementation.},

Abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems enable organizations to gain
   better control over their operations and costs by tightly integrating
   related business functions. This results in substantial savings. They
   provide a migration path from legacy systems to a client server
   environment. They also offer a solution to the year 2000 problem. This
   has led to a sharp increase in the demand for these systems.
   Implementation of ERP systems, however, is considered to be a high cost
   high risk project. Training is a key factor in implementation success.
   ERP implementation affects the roles of a large number of employees in
   an organization, who must be trained within a relatively short time
   period. Organizing and delivering such training in a cost effective and
   timely manner is a challenging task. Trainers are using innovative
   methods to accomplish this. Web-based training is recently gaining
   popularity as a convenient and economical means for imparting training
   to a large group of widely dispersed audience. In this article we
   describe an innovative use of intranet-based training to facilitate ERP
   implementation in a manufacturing organization.},

   integrated IT solution and more and more enterprises are increasing by
   adopting this system and regarding it as an important innovation.
   However, there is already evidence of high failure risks in ERP project
   implementation, one major reason is poor analysis of the requirements
   for system implementation. In this paper the authors highlight the
   importance of requirements analysis for ERP project implementation, and
   also present a requirements analysis framework by applying Quality
   Function Deployment (QFD); this will support to conduct requirements
   analysis for ERP project. This framework is based on the application of
   Quality Function Deployment (QFD), by also incoporating Balanced
   Scorecard (BSC) and Value Chain Analysis (VCA). The QFD can be extended
   to establish a series of matrixes to provide a clear, step-by-step
   requirements analysis framework. This converts enterprise vision into
   the requirements analysis for an ERP project. The BSC is used in
   acquiring the generation of input for QFD ``whats{''} and creating a
   business overview when planning objectives for the enterprise. The VCA
   can be deployed in aiding the generation of ``hows{''} and ensuring that
   all key business processes that add value are considered.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of business
   intelligence and analytics (BI\&A) in mediating the relationship between
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) and three sets of management
   accounting practices (MAPs): budgeting, costing and performance
   evaluation. It also examines the extent to which the usage of ERP
   affects the intensity of the application of various MAPs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Structural equation modeling (SmartPLS 3) is used to analyze data
   collected from a cross-sectional survey of 82 firms in the UAE. The
   results indicate that the constructs are valid and reliable and that the
   model supports the research hypotheses.
   Findings
   The findings confirm the positive effect of the extent of using ERP
   systems, as a construct of modules, on the extent of applying three sets
   of MAPs. They also show that the extent of the use of BI\&A systems
   partially mediates the relationship between the extent of the use of ERP
   systems and intensity of applying each of the three sets of MAPs.
   Practical implications
   The results encourage organizations to adopt BI\&A to reap the full
   benefits of ERP.
   Originality/value
   In contrast to the extant research that presumes a direct influence of
   ERP on MAPs, this study investigates if the extent of the use of BI\&A
   mediates the presumed relationship between the extent of the use of ERP
   and intensity of applying each of the three sets of MAPs.},

   incomplete information, so the risks evaluation system of ERP project
   can be seen a grey system. In the evaluation model of Grey Multilevel
   Hierarchy, the weight is very important. We develop the Grey Multilevel
   Hierarchy model for ERP project evaluation based on the combination of
   subjective and objective weight The weight determined by the combination
   weighting method can embody both the subjective and the objective
   information, and at last it is put into practice in the enterprise.},

Abstract = {The main problems that arise in adopting most enterprise resources
   planning (ERP) strategies come from organizational, rather than
   technical, issues, for example, social and cultural barriers, and user
   resistance. This paper analyzes the impact of cultural factors on user
   attitudes toward ERP use in public hospitals and identifying influencing
   factors. The theoretical grounding for this research is the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM). The proposed model has six constructs
   ({''}resistance to be controlled{''}, ``resistance to change{''},
   ``perceived risks{''}, ``perceived usefulness{''}, ``perceived ease of
   use{''}, and ``attitude toward using{''}), and nine hypotheses have been
   generated from the connections between these six constructs. Results
   suggest important practical implications for attitude toward using ERP
   and to develop an understanding about how to improve this attitude in
   hospitals. (C) 2013 ASEPUC. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.},

Abstract = {In modern era, the trend of global economic development and
   globalization has been increasingly intensive. In order to maintain
   competitive advantages, construction enterprises all over the world are
   always adopt the method of ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning)to improve
   operation efficiency. The aspect that most concerned by construction
   enterprises which have adopted ERP is that what are the influences and
   economic benefits ERP will bring to these enterprises. Balanced
   Scorecard is though the combination of finance target and non- finance
   target to contact the performance measurement and implementation of the
   strategy, design a set of target systems which can help senior managers
   to understand the situation of the enterprise performance. This paper
   introduces the concept of Balanced Scorecard(BSC), studies the
   corresponding relationship between the supply chain of ERP and the
   causation chain of BSC according to the characteristics of ERP and
   discusses the performance measurements system based on BSC under the
   condition of ERP, at the same time use the expert evaluation method. At
   last, we discuss how construction enterprises conduct performance
   management effectively.},

Abstract = {This research analyses factors and conditions that influence the
   acceptance of an Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) in the accounting
   department of a public company. The research is descriptive and uses the
   method Qualitative Case Study, adopting the UTAUT model as theoretical
   basis. Three sources were used to collect the data: semi-structured
   interviews, observation and document analysis. The data obtained show
   that the users' expectations were above what was perceived after the
   implementation of the integrated system, generating a frustrating
   sensation and impacting negatively in the usage intentions. This
   research allowed the identification, besides the user perceptions and
   expectations, of some reasons that make them refuse a new technology and
   could risk the high investments made to implement projects of this size.
   Furthermore, it shows that the accounting professional must be prepared
   to get adapted to the companies changes and help the manager to adopt
   solutions that improve the organizational performance.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper highlights how technical devices last in
   organizations. Instead of focusing on the usual implementation or
   short-term post-implementation phases, this study aims to explore what
   happens to established technical devices. Design/methodology/approach
   The authors build on a 10-year in-depth longitudinal case study
   examining a CRM package, a type of Enterprise Resource Planning system
   specialized in customer relationship management, in a door-drop
   advertising company. This case is based mainly on 35 interviews and four
   weeks of non-participant observation, made over three different periods.
   Findings Drawing on the literature on drift and maintenance, this study
   investigates two tensions foregrounding lasting: one regarding the
   degree of human intervention on the technical device (object being
   maintained vs object maintaining itself) and one regarding the
   relationship to the initial expectations towards the technical device
   (relinquishment of certain hopes vs regeneration of interests). This
   case combines these tensions and allows to highlight four alterations in
   the CRM system to show how apparently stable devices keep on changing.
   Social implications In a time of resource exhaustion, it is important to
   reflect upon our relationships to information technology and their
   modalities of lasting. By stressing that uses emerge from relinquishment
   and reduction, the authors wish to help organizations move towards more
   sustainable engagement with their technical devices in the long run.
   Originality/value Lasting is not just a matter of being maintained in a
   context of threat but also builds upon the capacities of a technical
   device to maintain itself. The self-alteration dynamics that the authors
   come up with, shedding and ramification, offer a dedramatized
   interpretation of maintenance that complements studies on institutional
   maintenance. The results also contribute to studies on technological
   drift. The authors stress that drifts are triggered by ties that run
   out, in particular, discontinuation of maintenance in the system. The
   durability of technical devices in organizations thus does not consist
   in always more uses or functionalities, but is also made of reductions
   and relinquishment.},

Abstract = {This paper studies direct and indirect impact of the human-centered
   Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems on user satisfaction. The
   objective of the paper is to measure a hierarchical influence of five
   human-centered dimensions on user satisfaction both directly and
   indirectly. This paper attempts to provide answers to whether the
   human-centered measurement models provide a systematic evaluation of
   ERP. The contributions of the paper to knowledge are to establish the
   need for the human-centered approach as a basis for the design of ERP
   systems, to define a systematic hierarchical human-centered model for
   measurement, in particular, and accounting information systems, in
   general, and to develop methodology for validation of the measurement
   model and applies it to evaluation of ERP systems. This paper suggests
   the application of a proposed five dimensional model in measuring the
   human-centeredness of ERP systems using hierarchical model and looks at
   the implementation in a university context.},

Abstract = {Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is critical to an organization's
   success. However, the factors that contribute to the success and usage
   of these ERP systems have received little attention. This study
   developed and validation of an improved DeLone-McLean IS success model.
   Additionally, we examined the factors which influence ERP system usage,
   employee satisfaction, information quality, service quality, and system
   quality, as well as the factors that influence the system's overall
   success. The proposed model is based on a mixed-methods case study
   (MM-CS). The re-sults show that the proposed model significantly
   measures the success of an ERP system. The organizational climate, the
   information quality, the system quality, and the service quality all
   have an impact on the usage of an ERP system. The proposed model also
   shows that the use of an ERP system, training and learning, and the
   three information (IS) quality constructs are all sig-nificant
   predictors of user satisfaction. The results also indicate that gender
   and years of ICT use on the path of ERP users have a moderating effect
   on the relationship between teamwork \& support and use.},

Abstract = {The interest generated by the ERP phenomenon in the public-sector is
   growing and the particularities of this sector make specific studies
   necessary. Just a few empirical studies have looked at public-sector
   motivations for ERP implementation. Based on the analysis of data from a
   survey of public organizations we seek, first, to characterize public
   organizations with regard to ERP. Secondly we try to identified and
   characterize the motivations that lead to the adoption of ERP Systems.
   Finally, our last aim is to identify and understand modules adoption in
   the public sector.
   This paper presents evidence from public organizations which implemented
   successfully ERP systems. Empirical evidence reveals that the need to
   increase the demand for real-time information, to obtain information for
   decision-making and the integration of applications appear as main
   reasons to implement an ERP system.
   Finally, this study reinforces the need for more research that is
   focused on Public sector organizations.},

Abstract = {This paper extends our knowledge on how software-based accounting tools
   might work effectively within an organization. The empirical data that
   we focus on are events that unfolded following the introduction of a new
   ERP system at an Ivy League University. We describe a negotiation
   process that occurred after roll-out that resulted in a reconfiguration
   of the ERP to integrate some of the legacy functionalities that were
   familiar to organizational participants and which were considered by
   them to provide a more effective way to manage their finances. Our
   contribution to the literature is not only to show the importance of
   such post-roll-out modifications for creating a working information
   system, but also to extend previous accounts of non-linear accounting
   change processes by emphasizing how these modifications are dependent on
   the particular entanglement of users and technology (the sociomaterial
   assemblage) rather than either features of the technology or the agency
   of the humans involved. Moreover, our analysis of the case data suggests
   that management accounting in particular may not be easily captured in
   ERP packages, even where the technology architectures are supposedly
   designed for a particular industry. The case data also points to issues
   of affordability and the power of communities of practice as mediating
   the extent to which these familiar accounting logics may become
   integrated within the ERP system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {System security is a top issue facing global organizations. This study
   investigates the constraints and benefits of a successful centralized
   end-to-end identity and access management (CLAM) implementation and the
   moderating role that ERP systems have in the implementation. We apply
   the Technology Organization Environment (TOE) framework to a case study
   approach. We find that organizational and technological factors result
   in lapses in IT governance and act as barriers to CIAM. Environmental
   factors also hinder CLAM implementation. Additionally, ERP systems
   facilitate the development of a CLAM due to integration and
   standardization of identities and automated provisioning. When the ERP
   system supports CLAM, the organization and its employees experience
   significant benefits including single sign-on capabilities, increased
   security and privacy, efficiencies in user provisioning and password
   management, and audit process improvement. Our results will be of value
   to any organization implementing CIAM and ERP. Researchers can also use
   our findings to further study IAM, ERP or extensions to the TOE
   framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With respect to multiple attribute decision making problems with
   interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information, some operational laws
   of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, score function and
   accuracy function of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are
   introduced. We utilize the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted
   geometric mean (IIFWGM) operator to aggregate the interval-valued
   intuitionistic fuzzy information corresponding to each alternative, and
   then rank the alternatives and select the most desirable one(s)
   according to the score function and accuracy function. Finally, an
   illustrative example about selecting an ERP system is given to verify
   the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and
   effectiveness.},

Title = {Enterprise Resource Planning System Usage and Stock Price Crash Risk},
Journal = {EUROPEAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {929-963},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {We examine whether Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP) usage
   affects the stock price crash risk of Chinese firms, and whether the
   effect differs between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs. We
   find that ERP usage is associated with lower stock price crash risk, but
   this pattern is largely concentrated in non-SOEs, consistent with our
   arguments that more acute shareholder-manager agency problem and more
   organizational rigidity can inhibit the successful assimilation of ERP.
   The results are further confirmed by a difference-in-differences
   analysis exploiting the privatization of SOEs as a negative shock to
   their shareholder-manager agency problem and organizational rigidity.
   Three channels help explain why ERP usage helps lower stock price crash
   risk: it improves the quality of internal control, reduces the chance of
   financial restatements, and mitigates information asymmetry, and all
   effects are concentrated in non-SOEs. Our study is among the first to
   examine how ERP usage affects stock price crash risk - an overall
   outcome measure of a firm's information environment. Using SOEs vs.
   non-SOEs as a powerful measure of the shareholder-manager agency problem
   and organizational rigidity, it also represents the first test of the
   moderating effect of agency problem and organizational rigidity on the
   effectiveness of ERP usage.},

Abstract = {The ERP impact on management accounting practices has been widely
   recognised as having a knowledge gap in relation to how it may
   facilitate Segmental Information Reporting following the International
   Financial Reporting Standard No. 8's (IFRS-8) management approach. This
   study contributes to filling this gap by investigating the joint effect
   of the ERP and IFRS-8 Post-Implementation Review (PIR) on dimensions:
   quality, quantity and the reporters' identity of FTSE-100 companies in
   the period 2013-2017. The study found that ERP is significantly and
   positively associated with the dimensions of segmental information
   reporting. The implications of this study extend research and the
   practices of segmental reporting on the importance of ERP in
   operationalising segmental reporting and in understanding variations.},

Title = {Enterprise resource planning system reforms of European Union member
   states in association with central government accrual accounting and
   IPSAS adoption},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC BUDGETING ACCOUNTING \& FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},

Pages = {115-140},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper examines the enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems of 27 European central governments and the governments'
   respective information technology (IT) reforms, facilitator role and
   association with accrual accounting reforms as premise of the
   International Public Sector Accounting Standards
   (IPSAS).Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a qualitative and
   content analysis of 27 European Union (EU) member states (MSs) regarding
   the states' IT and accounting maturity in association with accrual
   accounting as breeding ground for IPSAS convergence based on published
   surveys on behalf of Eurostat, web data and emails collected from
   authorized officials.FindingsThis paper has found that (1) increased
   accounting and IT maturity scores of central governments are associated
   with the establishment or upgrade of ERP systems; (2) ERP systems prove
   to facilitate and support accrual accounting adoption; (3) in majority,
   EU MSs adopt similar ERP vendors to implement accrual accounting
   reforms; (4) with prevalence among ERP vendors, the Systems Application
   Products (SAP) ERP software proves to be a success story toward public
   sector accounting (PSA) reforms.Research
   limitations/implicationsRespective information on the ERP systems'
   facilitation to financial accounting reforms is collected only for 17
   central governments.Originality/valueThis paper highlights the
   facilitation of ERP systems as reform drivers to accrual accounting
   change of EU MSs, through IT modernization. This paper links the ERP
   practices with specific ERP vendors pointing out the vendors'
   similarities. This paper presents examples of European ERP reforms and
   sets the reforms as reference for central governments that wish to
   embark on ERP and accrual accounting reforms.},

Title = {The paradoxes of the reengineering of information flows for management
   control: A case study in a public university hospital},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study analyses the organisational reengineering processes developed
   following the adoption of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
   in a public university hospital. Interestingly, a public university
   hospital was obliged to adhere to a regional ERP system owing to
   regulatory requirements. This caused the elimination of the pre-existing
   information flow architecture and the need for further reengineering.
   The analysis examines a case study in which reengineering information
   flow is conducted with ERP and business intelligence (BI) systems,
   highlighting the positive results. Using a data warehouse based on the
   ERP and BI systems allowed it to transform data into useful information,
   providing a global and detailed vision of the university hospital's
   performance through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Indeed,
   reengineering processes have made it possible to reorganise information
   flows consistent with the needs of new information systems.},

   Homogeneity across Audit Clients: A New Form of Knowledge Spillover?},

Abstract = {We examine the effects of a large number of clients in an audit office
   using the same enterprise -resource planning (ERP) system such as SAP or
   Oracle resulting in what we term ``client accounting system
   homogeneity{''} on audit efficiency and effectiveness. Using a unique
   dataset of ERP system implementations, we find that accounting system
   homogeneity is positively associated with audit efficiency.
   Specifically, we find lower (higher) audit fees for clients using an ERP
   system from a vendor used by a higher (lower) proportion of clients in
   that office. We further document that accounting system homogeneity is
   associated with improved audit effectiveness as proxied by two
   accruals-based measures, incorrect internal control weakness reporting,
   and restatements. Our findings are reflective of a new form of knowledge
   spillover from repeated experiences auditing clients using similar
   accounting systems, resulting in audits that are not only less expensive
   but also of higher quality.},

Abstract = {A new field of innovation research is developing around complex product
   systems (CoPS). CoPS are technology-intensive capital goods that forms
   the backbone of modem economy. The research on CoPS has just begun in
   China recently. Prior researches have raised innovation networks of CoPS
   and found related management determinants. Our paper extends prior
   researches by first applying stakeholder theory to technological
   innovation in development of CoPS, We construct the stakeholder analysis
   model in technological innovation of CoPS from two dimensions of power
   and interest to assess their features. Then we use a case of ERP project
   to support the theoretical model. This paper makes a contribution to
   research on stakeholder-based view of innovation management of CoPS.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the consequences of information systems
   compatibility between the target and acquirer firms in the context of
   mergers and acquisitions (M\&A). Using a unique data set of ERP
   implementations, we find that acquirers using the same ERP vendor as
   their targets exhibit shorter post-merger operating cycles and shorter
   post-merger audit delays relative to acquirers with different ERP
   vendors than their targets. In supplemental analysis, we find evidence
   that acquirers with the same ERP vendor as their target also exhibit
   more accurate management forecast guidance following the acquisition.
   The findings of this study should be of interest to capital market
   participants and managers involved in M\&A activity by providing
   evidence about how the degree of compatibility between acquirer and
   target ERP systems impacts post-merger activities across different
   economically significant functional areas.},

Abstract = {The ERP type integrated information technology (IT) systems are found
   especially in the large multinational corporations. The costs and the
   sustainability of these systems are main factors that small and medium
   sized enterprises take into account when deciding to implement them.
   This research focuses on an analysis among different types of ERP
   systems and puts an emphasis in showing how these types of systems could
   become sustainable in the frame of smaller enterprises. New means of
   approaching and projecting these IT systems and the new information
   technology could offer sustainable solutions in the small and medium
   sized enterprises. This article analyzes the existing and possible

Abstract = {This paper explores the critical success factors (CSF) of enterprise
   resources planning (ERP) implementation based on risk management theory.
   Five CSF categories are proposed, namely: system risk, implementation
   risk, change risk, organization risk, staff risk after widely literature
   review. A survey is developed to collected data from ERP suppliers and
   firms in Xi'an to test the proposed model. The results from our survey
   show that ERP success significantly depends on clerk risk and
   implementation risk.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of relevant internal controls at the
   post-implementation phase remains limited in spite of general guidance
   from professional frameworks or standards. In this study, based on the
   COBIT 5 framework, we reviewed 56 studies from relevant academic
   journals from 1998 to 2014 to form an initial list of information
   technology (IT) internal control items for the post-implementation phase
   of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. An expert survey was
   conducted to validate the list, and 45 control items were ranked using
   the Delphi method. The proposed items may assist companies and auditors
   in focusing on essential internal control issues during the ERP system
   post-implementation phase.},

Abstract = {Embedded Audit Modules (EAMs) have been the subject of discussion in the
   literature for more than two decades. Early implementations of EAMs were
   tied to proprietary accounting information systems and production
   systems. In recent years, there has been considerable development and
   widespread deployment of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that
   provide common business process functionality across the enterprise.
   These systems are based upon a common foundation provided by large scale
   relational database management systems. There has been no published
   research that addresses the potential for exploiting the perceived
   benefits of EAMs in an ERP environment. This paper seeks to, at least in
   part, close this gap in the research literature. The research is
   designed to assess the level and nature of support for EAMs by ERP
   providers.},

Abstract = {This research aims to analyze the ways in which skills and personal
   features of the Chief Information Officers (CIOs) could affect the ERP
   (Enterprise Resource Planning) implementation and management in the
   Italian context. Furthermore, we attempt to analyze how the different
   ways of ERP implementation and management could contribute to improve
   the firms' performance. Prior studies demonstrated the link between the
   adoption of an IT (Information Technology) and the financial and
   non-financial performance ratios of a firm. Even if scholars found
   controversial results about it, they all seem to agree that deeper and
   more positive improvements related to an ERP adoption could be
   introduced only after a certain lag of years. Recent literature about
   this topic also highlights that the CIOs' role with his/her features,
   such as background, managerial competencies, technical skills are
   essential factors in obtaining positive economic returns for IT
   investment and in improving the overall firms' performance. Despite
   these considerations, it has not still been paid enough attention to the
   recent and evolving role of the CIOs' personal features and how the
   different ways of ERP implementation and management could contribute to
   improve the firms' performance. In order to reach our main aim, we carry
   out 10 in-depth pilot interviews to Italian CIOs to elicit early
   qualitative feedback and we send the survey questions to the CIOs who
   are willing to have collaboration with our research project. The survey
   has the main aim to test research items identified from the pilot
   interviews, in an exploratory and subjective viewpoint. Results
   contribute to the theoretical and practical definition of the relevant
   profiles attributable to CIOs and the impacts of each profile to firms'
   performance.},

Abstract = {This teaching case aims to allow the analysis of elements related to
   public management, project management, information technology
   management, and eventually organizational learning. A public company in
   the financial sector, CASA bank, begins a major project to implement an
   information system to control the financing portfolio and to integrate
   its business processes, but the organizational climate does not favor
   the success of the enterprise, because of failed experiences in the
   past. And the manager, mr. Tome, has to conduct this project, in all its
   dimensions, applying the best practices and management techniques. This
   case of teaching invites future managers to put themselves in the skin
   of Mr. Tome, who assumed the mission of replacing CASA's legacy
   financing control system with little experience and knowledge in the
   area of business that the system must meet. What to do when faced with a
   great task, with many demands to fulfill, with high expectations of the
   personnel involved, but plagued by technical and administrative
   dilemmas, enhanced by the peculiarities and legal limitations of public
   companies and by the organizational climate disadvantaged by the
   failures of the past?},

Abstract = {The new enterprise application systems will have to be more
   customer-focused, incorporating e-commerce interaction and collaboration
   with business partners. E-Business technology and ERP applications are
   proven powerful business tools. Like the large companies, the small and
   medium-sized ones need to consider the potential of ERP and E-Business
   in their business processes. They will significantly change the way of
   doing business, but in a good and profitable way. Outsourcing of ERP
   operations is the next emerging trend as a company can typically save
   operational costs close to 50\%. With the improvement in connectivity,
   the option of ``ERP as a service{''} using the SaaS (Software as a
   Service) model is now proving to be viable. The paper will depict the
   enterprise applications that suit the SMEs, the technological challenges
   they have to reach, and the applications implementation options.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses how two companies pursued integration of management
   and control through enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. We
   illustrate how the quest for integration is an unending process and it
   is produced concurrently and episodically. Integration is not only about
   `mere' visibility and control at a distance. ERP systems do not define
   what integration is and how it is to be developed, but they incur a
   techno-logic that conditions how control can be performed through
   financial and non-financial representations because they distinguish
   between an accounting mode and a logistics mode. A primary lesson from
   our cases is that control cannot be studied apart from technology and
   context because one will never get to understand the underlying
   `infrastructure'-the meeting point of many technologies and many types
   of controls. ERP systems are particularly interesting for what they make
   impossible, and our cases illustrate how the two organizations in the
   quest for integration mobilized a number of `boundary objects' to
   overcome systems-based `blind spots' and `trading zones'. The paper
   points out that management control in an ERP-environment is not a
   property of the accounting function but a collective affair were local
   control issues in different parts of the organization are used to create
   notions of global management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   The introduction and application of Process Management in China is
   relatively late, and there are some misunderstandings about the concept
   and technology practice. This article analyses the history and the
   present situation of Process Management practiced by Chinese
   corporations. It points out that since the Chinese opening reform and
   with the development of information technology, the idea of Process
   Management has been accepted by both the theory researchers and
   practitioners in Chinese corporation management field. According to the
   ERP operation experience in China, we found that if we attach importance
   to reformation of management and impel Process Management in the
   company, it is absolutely possible for a traditional in-efficient
   organization turn into a highly efficient one.},

Abstract = {The process to implement a Strategic Management Accounting (SMA) system
   is quite long and complex. SMA is not a separate item: it should be
   linked and closely integrated with the rest of the Accounting
   Information System (AIS). Firstly, the core of the AIS, the ERP system,
   should work properly, acting as the main source for the SMA system.
   Secondly, it is necessary a great empowerment of the management, which
   is supposed to operate directly the SMA system. The first part of the
   paper describes the SMA theoretical framework, discussing the more
   recent theories. The second part describes a medium-size company and its
   experiences in implementing a SMA system. In particular, we will
   describe the Nespoli Group, which comprehends 45 medium-size firms
   localized all-over Europe and the issues linked to the management of
   such a differentiated multinational ensemble of entities. The third part
   highlights the specific characteristics of the Nespoli Group SMA system.
   Several final considerations conclude the paper.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of IT\&C contribution to the organization performance
   concerns both the academic researchers and the organizations'
   practitioners. Starting from the well known paradox of Sollow ``You can
   see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics{''},
   two questions became recurrent and delicate in research: To what extent
   the use of IT\&C and, particularly Enterprise Resource Planning systems
   (ERPS), contribute to the organizations overall performance improvement?
   and What performance are we talking about? The results of empirical
   researches are, until now, conflicting, even contradictory.
   Our paper synthesizes the primary literature on the topic, makes
   conceptual clarifications and helps develop a theoretical framework and
   several global models for analyzing the impact of ERPS use on
   organization's performance and users' satisfaction, as an important
   factor for improving individual and group performance.},

Abstract = {Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are software module packages
   which can be customized up to a certain limit to suit the specific needs
   of each organization. Many ERP projects have not been effective at
   achieving all of the intended results due to high cost and high failure
   risks in ERP implementation. This study integrates the prior theories
   and knowledge gained from several textile industry practitioners for ERP
   projects. A two-stage method involving the Delphi and analytic hierarchy
   process decision support methodology was conducted. Based on the case of
   the textile industry in Taiwan, the findings illustrate the top 10 key
   factors: a clear project plan by defined ERP capacity requirement; a
   limited scope and focused flowchart; goal congruence between ERP project
   implementation and corporate strategy; top management support and
   commitment; the extent of standard operating procedures and
   institutional processes; a user-friendly interface; systems integrated
   with aggressive schedules and timelines; provision of technical
   assistance for rapid, effective transfer of best practice interventions;
   good interdepartmental communication and coordination on a focused issue
   solution; and enablement of business process reengineering and solid
   management for project team building. The findings of this research will
   be beneficial to those apparel companies that adopted the ERP.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the valuation of general contingent claims with short
   selling bans under the equal-risk pricing (ERP) framework proposed in I.
   Guo \& S.-P. Zhu (2017) {[}Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 76,
   136-151]. In existing literature, analytical pricing formulae were
   derived in the special case, where the payoff function is monotonic
   under risk-neutral measures. In this paper, we establish a unified
   framework for this new pricing approach so that its range of application
   can be significantly expanded. The results of I. Guo \& S.-P. Zhu (2017)
   {[}Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 76, 136-151] are extended to
   the case of non-monotonic payoffs (such as a butterfly spread option)
   under risk-neutral measures. We also provide numerical schemes for
   computing equal-risk prices under other measures such as the original
   physical measure. Furthermore, we demonstrate how short selling bans can
   affect the valuation of contingent claims by comparing equal-risk prices
   with Black-Scholes prices.},

Abstract = {This study signifies knowledge as strategic resources in attaining
   organisational mission and vision. With the increasing trend of employee
   turnover, the need to retain knowledge is a challenge, and thus,
   fostering organisational knowledge sharing is an option to uphold the
   knowledge. The advancement of the technology, together with management
   control systems have crucial roles in effectively sharing knowledge.
   This study aims to examine the relationship between Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP), management control (MC) and their complementarity effect
   towards facilitating organisational knowledge sharing (KS) practice.
   Questionnaires were administered to top management of randomly selected
   manufacturer listed in the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers
   Directory. 114 usable responses were analysed using partial least square
   structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate positive
   and significant relationships between ERP, MC and KS, hence suggesting
   the knowledge sharing role of ERP and MC as governing mechanism to KS.
   The complementarity effect between ERP and MC was also found to be
   positively associated with KS. The results provide evidence on the
   importance of appropriate governing control mechanism in combination
   with enhanced technology to foster organizational knowledge-sharing
   practice.},

Abstract = {Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are indispensable for a
   majority of larger and midsize firms, and have changed the way
   accounting information is collected, stored, processed, and
   disseminated. Although most ERP systems integrate an eXtensible Business
   Reporting Language ( XBRL) component in their core modules, little
   research has examined how ERP systems affect the quality of XBRL
   filings. Using unique data from branchlevel ERP implementation, we find
   that the degree of ERP adoption among a firm's branches is negatively
   associated with the firm's XBRL filing errors and positively associated
   with XBRL reporting comparability, which in turn facilitates external
   users' access to the firm's XBRL filings in the SEC's EDGAR. These
   results suggest that ERP systems improve XBRL reporting quality.
   Moreover, our results indicate that ERP can mitigate the negative effect
   of extension taxonomies on XBRL reporting quality, which highlights the
   importance of the ERP system in a complicated XBRL reporting
   environment.},

Abstract = {This study aims to determine the impact of implementing the Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) system on improving the company's financial
   performance. The company's financial performance is measured based on
   financial ratios, namely Labor Productivity and Net Profit Margin. Data
   were analyzed by comparing various ratios over 3 years before and after
   ERP system implementation. The results showed that there was an increase
   in productivity, but did not prove an increase in profitability after
   the company implemented the ERP system. Therefore, further research can
   be directed at the level of ERP system implementation, because companies
   may have no background in implementing an ERP system.},

Abstract = {In application of enterprise resource planning (ERP), the accuracy,
   timeliness and consistency of the business data are the key factors
   effecting normal operation of ERP system. The policy of vendor managed
   inventory (VMI) is applied in the engine work, which has brought changes
   in the management processes in sales, planning and inventory. This has
   led to the situation in which application of ERP system couldn't meet
   enterprise practical demands. In order to protect the investment of ERP
   system in the enterprise, and adapt to the changes of outer and inner
   environment of enterprise, this paper puts forward with the VMI model
   based on the ERP platform. It has constructed the mixed system
   architecture of distributed VMI based on client/server model and
   browse/server model, by using personal digital assistant, barcode
   technology, wireless network, internet, which has realized the
   timeliness and the accuracy of data collection in acceptance, delivery,
   transferring on materials of purchase and sale. This paper has realized
   the integration of purchase planning, purchase acceptance, product
   delivery, material demand, sale delivery between ERP and VMI by using
   interface technology; it has enhanced the operating efficiency of ERP,
   and realized the information integration of vendors, manufacturers and
   customers among the supply-chain.},

   system was created in a multinational enterprise. The empirical findings
   were gathered from different actors involved in the implementation of
   enterprise's ABC and ERP projects. Our study focuses on the ontological
   politics {[}Mol, A.-M., 1999. Ontological politics. A word and some

   After. Blackwell, Malden, MA, pp. 74-89] required for the creation of a

   objects and subjects with potential for creating new agencies {[}Latour,

   (one division of the enterprise), the new agency was labelled `virtual
   integration', its purpose being to enable a new vision of the
   profitability of the division's production chain. Our results highlight
   the unstable and complex nature of such systems, which no doubt impedes
   their use. We contribute to the understanding of such systems, with a
   special emphasis on the use of metaphors in the political process that
   accounting information systems must pass through in order to become
   established as an enterprise-wide management tool. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {The examination of the beneficial impact of enterprise resource planning
   systems (ERPs) on firm performance appears in extensive literature.
   Prior studies also examine how ERP implementations impact the timeliness
   of financial information. Few studies, however, address the question of
   whether the increase in managers' access to accounting data
   differentially influences managerial behavior. We investigate the
   association of ERP implementation with managers' flexibility to deviate
   from normal operating practices to present better financial results. Our
   findings suggest that after the implementation of an ERP, earnings
   management through real activities declines. These results particularly
   indicate that ERP implementations enhance the quality of financial
   reporting by constraining opportunistic managerial behavior.},

Title = {How Do Stock Market Development and Competitiveness Affect Equity Risk
   Premium? Implications from World Economies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper examines the interrelatedness between countries'
   stock market development and competitiveness and the equity risk premium
   (hereinafter, ERP). In addition, this paper examines the length of time
   that stock market development takes to have an impact of ERP. The
   results offer an empirical guide to stock market authorities about the
   robust factors that help reduce ERP, which, in turn, encourages raising
   equity financing. Design/methodology: The dataset includes 59 countries
   that are listed in the market potential index (hereinafter, MPI)
   covering the years 1996 to 2020. The MPI provides comprehensive
   macroeconomic factors that can be used for examining stock market
   competitiveness and, thus, its potential effects on ERP. Findings: The
   results of the robustness test show that (a) a negative and significant
   association exists between the turnover ratio of domestic shares to
   stocks traded and ERP, (b) the increases in stock market competitiveness
   are associated with increases in the number of listed companies, (c)
   lowly ranked countries in the MPI are associated with increasing ERP,
   and (d) in terms of the interaction between duration of stock market
   development and competitiveness, the relatively competitive stock
   markets take 2-6 years for stock market development indicators to have a
   significant effect on ERP. Originality: This paper offers two main
   contributions to the related literature. The first contribution is to
   offer a measure of stock market competitiveness using indicators of
   stock market development. Therefore, robust indicators of stock market
   development can be reached. The second contribution is to offer
   empirical results about the length of time (referred to in this paper as
   duration) required for the indicators of stock market development to
   have a favorable effect on ERP.},

Abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the efficiency of
   Korean insurers that have adopted enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   system to improve their efficiency.
   Design/methodology/approach-The study uses Data Envelopment Analysis
   (DEA) with several inputs and outputs to measure both technical and
   scale efficiency. With the efficiency measures and using the ordinary
   least square with the hetereoscedacity consistent standard errors, the
   study further investigates the factors affecting efficiency, and the
   association between ERP and efficiency.
   Findings-This study finds a strong positive association between ERP
   implementation and the insurers' efficiency and profitability. However,
   firms may experience a decrease in efficiency and profitability during
   the first and second year after ERP implementation. Research
   limitations/implications-Although the findings of this study are
   consistent with extant studies, the study's findings may lack
   generalizability because the samples are limited small Korean
   Property/Casualty (P/C) insurers.
   Originality/value-This study investigates the impact of ERP
   implementation on P/C insurers in an emerging market.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the effects of implementing an Enterprise Resource
   Planning system (ERP) upon management control in two multinational
   organisations. How ERP was configured in each corporation created
   different forms of distance and relations between headquarters and the
   scattered subsidiaries. The construction of spatial and temporal
   separations (i.e. distance) and how they were understood and managed had
   profound effects on management control. In one organisation the ERP
   reproduced existing structures and distance which permitted conventional
   accounting controls based on action at a distance to be maintained. The
   second organisation used ERP to collapse distance through real-time
   information in a matrix structure. This did not increase centralisation
   but rather produced constantly changing loci of control and managerial
   feelings of `minimalist' control. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {We illustrate the role of left tail dependence-left tail mean (LTM)-in
   equity risk premium (ERP) predictability. LTM measures the average of
   pairwise left tail dependency among major equity sectors incorporating
   shocks imperceptible at the aggregate level. LTM, as well as the
   variance risk premium, significantly predicts the ERP in and out of
   sample, which is not the case with commonly used predictors. We find
   this predictability is the result of procyclical shocks' reversals in a
   stable business cycle. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on
   ERP predictability. (JEL G10, G12, G14)},

Abstract = {The process of implementation of ERP is influenced not only by internal
   factors (resources of an organisation and the system itself), but also
   factors of the micro- and macro-environment. Implementation of
   enterprise resource planning systems is a complex process influenced by
   a large number of internal and external components. The aim of this
   article is to investigate the peculiarities of the process of
   implementation of enterprise resource planning systems and to establish
   the critical factors of the success. In order to establish the opinion
   of Lithuanian ERP specialists and users regarding the importance of the
   factors determining the result of implementation of ERP the survey was
   conducted. Experts of ERP implementation consider as the most important
   factors determining the Success Of implementation the management factors
   relating to such fields as management. planning, implementation and
   control of projects and organisational changes.},

Volume = {31},
Number = {6},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {While there is significant evidence of a positive historical realized
   equity risk premium (ERP), it is less clear how equity returns have
   varied in different bond yield environments (the expected ERP). This
   paper explores historical expected ERPs across 16 countries from 1870 to
   2015 leveraging the Jorda-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory database. We
   find evidence that while future equity returns have been lower during
   periods of lower bond yields, the decline is less than would be implied
   by a constant expected ERP. The predictive significance of bond yields
   varies significantly depending on the future return metric considered
   (nominal return versus real return, as well as total return versus price
   return), as well as whether dividend yields and recent inflation are
   considered. Overall, these results suggest that while equity returns are
   likely to be lower in a low bond yield environment, they are not likely
   to be as low as a constant ERP would suggest, and that the overall
   relation is relatively noisy.},

Abstract = {The equity risk premium (ERP) in BRIC markets is, on average,

   explains the BRIC ERP. It turns out that there is a puzzle with respect
   to BRIC data as well. This holds even if we account for high levels of
   aversion to consumption and utility risk and for the empirically
   observed autoregressive structure of US consumption and BRIC dividend
   growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Using option prices to extract expected market risk premia (ERP) across
   international stock markets, we show that the term structure of the ERP
   is slightly downward sloping, but its slope becomes steeply downward
   sloping during bad economic times. Indeed, formal tests show that shocks
   to international expected equity excess returns are highly integrated,
   especially during recessions. Moreover, as additional evidence of
   international integration, these expectation shocks impact in a similar
   way the realized returns of popular risk factors across stock markets.
   The exposures of risk factors to changes in ERP across international
   markets are highly integrated.},

Abstract = {Business trends show that more and more employees are creating shadow IT
   systems-IT systems that are not sanctioned or monitored by the IT
   department. This paper examines how the use of shadow IT in product
   costing impacts managers' perceptions of information credibility and
   managerial decision making. Using two experiments, we find that
   participants view information from shadow IT systems as less credible
   and they are less impacted by and less willing to rely on costing
   reports produced from shadow IT systems versus non-shadow IT systems. We
   also find that although participants are concerned about the credibility
   of shadow IT systems, they are not more likely to find simple
   mathematical errors embedded in shadow IT costing reports relative to
   non-shadow IT reports. This suggests that although concerned about
   shadow IT systems, managers still do not exercise sufficient care in
   evaluating reports created using these systems. The results of our study
   should prove informative as shadow systems become more prevalent in
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Practice changes attendant on CRM software packages implementations are
   studied, thanks to a ten year in-depth longitudinal case study. We show
   first, that the changes in control practices outweigh, in our case,
   those in customer knowledge practices, even if the changes vary
   depending on periods and teams. In addition, the changes in control
   practices are more varied and include topics and people that had not
   been expected. We show that CRM software packages transform control
   practices in depth even though the way they are used can make their
   utility rather modest in terms of customer knowledge. Change is thus not
   necessarily where it was expected.},

Abstract = {Asset allocation is critically dependent on the ability to forecast the
   equity risk premium (ERP) out-of-sample. But, is superior econometric
   predictability across the business cycle synonymous with predictability
   at all times? We evaluate recently introduced ERP forecasting models,
   which have been shown to generate econometrically superior ERP
   forecasts, and find that their forecasting ability is regime-dependent.
   They give rise to significant relative losses during market downturns,
   when it matters the most for asset allocators to retain assets and their
   client base intact. Conversely, any economic benefit occurring during
   market upswings is diminished for high risk-averse and
   leverage-constrained investors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Currency exchange rate volatility can affect the natural rubber price
   because most agricultural commodities are traded in USD. The objectives
   of the study is to determine the impact of exchange rate volatility on
   both natural rubber (NR) prices of (SMR20 and RSS4); and forecast a
   short-term exchange rate price (ERP) of Malaysian Ringgit (RM per USD)
   and both NR prices strongly represented in the Asian region, Malaysian
   NR market. The granger causal relationship is first analyzed along the
   VECM model with more efficient Engle-Granger causality procedure. Both a
   short-term ERP and NR prices ex-ante forecasts are tested by using
   Pindyck and Rubinfeld's procedures. The result shows the RSS4 price
   Granger-cause changes the SMR20 and ERP with unidirectional causality
   relationship. Both a short-term ERP and NR prices ex-ante forecasts
   would be on a slightly increasing trend from January to June 2016. It
   may be due to the government and traders in changing their behaviour by
   increasing domestic consumptions for the stabilization of the NR
   supply-demand balance.},

Title = {Deep Equal Risk Pricing of Financial Derivatives with Non-Translation
   Invariant Risk Measures},
Journal = {RISKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The objective is to study the use of non-translation invariant risk
   measures within the equal risk pricing (ERP) methodology for the
   valuation of financial derivatives. The ability to move beyond the class
   of convex risk measures considered in several prior studies provides
   more flexibility within the pricing scheme. In particular, suitable
   choices for the risk measure embedded in the ERP framework, such as the
   semi-mean-square-error (SMSE), are shown herein to alleviate the price
   inflation phenomenon observed under the tail value at risk-based ERP as
   documented in previous work. The numerical implementation of
   non-translation invariant ERP is performed through deep reinforcement
   learning, where a slight modification is applied to the conventional
   deep hedging training algorithm so as to enable obtaining a price
   through a single training run for the two neural networks associated
   with the respective long and short hedging strategies. The accuracy of
   the neural network training procedure is shown in simulation experiments
   not to be materially impacted by such modification of the training
   algorithm.},

Abstract = {Blockchain and cloud computing continue to emerge and evolve as
   important technologies for data management. This has strategic
   implications for data stored in enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems. We use manufacturing bills of materials (MBOMs) as an example
   of critical data in ERP. MBOMs define the complex product structures of
   manufacturing enterprises. We survey five alternatives for storing,
   controlling, and auditing MBOMs in ERP: Oracle Blockchain Table; Oracle
   Blockchain Platform Enterprise Edition; Microsoft Azure SQL Database
   Ledger; SAP HANA Blockchain Ledgers; and IBM Blockchain Platform. We
   also consider cloud computing without blockchain technologies. We
   analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative by its
   effect on the management of MBOMs. Although we use MBOMs in our
   illustrations, many of the concepts discussed also apply to other
   critical data stored in ERPs.},

Abstract = {Knowledge management is crucial to organizational survival and
   development, it is an important foundation of knowledge innovation of
   enterprise. The aim of implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   system is to construct a knowledge management system with core
   competence, and to realize the innovation of business process and
   organizational structure on the basis of knowledge management system. In
   the process of implementing ERP system, searching for the key points of
   innovation of business process reengineering and organizational
   structure is always the most crucial. As a thinking of systematic
   optimization, the theory of constraints (TOC) reveals the existence of
   system constraints, and should be a feasible method in the process of
   knowledge management and innovation. As a method of multi-attributes
   group decision-making and data fusion, combined weighted geometric
   averaging (CWGA) operator can be used to search for system constraints.
   The paper proposes a method of knowledge innovation by using CWGA
   operator to search for the system constraints, and then illustrates the
   feasibility of CWGA with an example. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the
   methods of innovation of business process and structure of organization
   systematically as well, aimed for ERP and based on TOC, so as to drive
   the implementation process of ERP system, and to establish an effective
   system of knowledge management innovation.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to address the extant and arguable role of
   enterprise systems (ES) in relation to management accounting practices
   (MAPs) through an inclusion relative neglect account of business process
   management (BPM). This is also extended to draw out an analytical
   framework to advance our understanding of how BPM mediate ES-MAPs
   interplay.
   Design/methodology/approach - Across-sectional case study was adopted as
   a research strategy with which to collect data about the ES-BPM-MAPs
   interplay as a unit of analysis. The latter, in the first stage, was
   examined across (89) mini-case studies operating in the UK context
   through reports and documentations collected from cases' websites,
   vendors and consultants of information systems. Drawn insights from
   cross-sectional analysis and contributions made by prior studies are
   blended together to inform the second stage that outlines an analytical
   framework for ES-BPM-MAPs interplay.
   Findings - Different ES are mobilised to address different orientations
   of BPMs and being used for different managerial functions and purposes.
   Different patterns of ES-BPM-MAPs interplay are identified across (89)
   UK-case studies and the BPM is a fulcrum understanding. These patterns
   are centred around three key BPM including customer, logistics and
   control processes and all oriented by a continuum of an organisation
   intention focus on control, understanding and strategising. Both
   processes and orientations explain ES development and MAPs evolution
   processes. Standardisation, integration and intelligence are key
   characteristics sought through ES mobilisations. By complementary,
   information provision, analytics and simulation are three sophisticated
   ways of using MA information facilitated by ES characteristics.
   Research limitations/implications - Dynamic processes of MAPs change
   over time and are beyond the reach of this study. Such approach requires
   full access to case studies. BPM is fulcrum understanding of MAPs change
   and/or stability in relation to ES implementation including other
   components.
   Practical implications - Findings and analytical framework could be used
   as a base for establishing the best approach in adopting ES to fully
   exploit the potential of future ES applications as well as to avoid
   organisations pitfalls of implementations. Organisations are advised to
   understand their existing business processes, characteristics of MA
   information would be achieved first upon which decision of ES components
   selection and implementation could be outlined.
   Originality/value - The indirect interplay between ES and MAPs through
   business processes is rarely examined. By the inclusion of BPM and using
   cross-sectional case studies, this research contributes to the existing
   shortcomings of ES-MAPs interplay by broadening the picture and
   proposing an analytical framework. The latter advances our understanding
   by focusing on attributes of ES-BPM-MAPs upon which informal changes
   in-the use of MAPs are recognised.},

Abstract = {This article is the second of a two-part series that develops a
   framework for comparative valuation of major equity markets around the
   world. In this article, the authors invert the dividend discount model
   (DDM) discussed in ``Fair Value in Global Equities: Part I,{''}
   published in the preceding issue of this journal, in order to extract a
   time series of the implied equity risk premium (ERP) and the real
   required return (RRR). They estimate regression equations to find the
   macroeconomic drivers of these series. The ERP increases with the output
   gap at home and abroad, as well as with high past values of the ERP.
   This relationship allows for benchmarking the ERP and the RRR to the
   current economic environment and to forecasts of the future economic
   environment. The authors compare the use of these tools with other ways
   to forecast returns. At a five-year horizon, valuation alone is a good
   predictor of future returns, and the current value of the RRR works
   particularly well in this regard. At a one-year horizon, forecasts based
   on the benchmarking of the RRR to the future economic environment work
   significantly better than traditional valuation metrics, if the economic
   outlook is correct.},

Abstract = {Enterprise resource planning (ERP) was originated in the manufacturing
   industry. It provides a general working environment for an enterprise to
   integrate its major business management function with one single common
   database so that information can be shared and efficient communication
   can be achieved between management functions. This paper briefs the ERP
   technology and its current development in general. Based on the needs of
   enhancing the core competitiveness of an enterprise, the construction of
   informatization is a best choice for the enterprise. However the unique
   nature of real estate enterprise in China prevents a direct
   implementation of existing ERP systems which are developed for the
   manufacturing industry. This paper underlines the characteristics of
   real estate enterprise and presents a real estate enterprise resource
   planning (REERP). Combined with a development of REERP, the authors shed
   light on the model, functions and architecture of REERP. Implications of
   our framework are outlined to guide future practice and research.},

Title = {Reviewing literature through multidimensional representations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reviewing literature is a demanding task that calls for effective tools.
   After examining literature review (LR) practices, this paper develops an
   innovative approach in representing literature. In particular, the paper
   introduces depictions based on a three-dimensional structure that
   enables the generation of unitary and highly informative literature
   representations, thereby improving the completeness and reducing the
   mismatch between field complexity and the traditional figures and tables
   of LRs. The viability of the designed solution is shown by replicating a
   published LR on a representative topic of the accounting information
   systems (AIS), namely a literature review on enterprise resource
   planning systems in SMEs. Its benefits arise from comparing the
   literature representation developed here with the original figures. The
   paper has methodological and practical implications. Indeed, it proposes
   a structured approach to improve the representation of multifaceted
   literature, but it can also be suitable for other types of analysis. The
   efficiency and efficacy benefits that emerged from the evaluation
   activity make the output of the paper useful both for researchers and
   academic research users. In the light of developments in AIS research,
   the article also comments on potential applications in this area by
   examining some recently published LRs.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to analyze the implications of technology
   change on management control. Specifically, the paper seeks to examine
   the deployment of an enterprise resource planning system (ERP), and to
   apply a temporal perspective of practice as a theoretical tool to
   discuss the effects of the ERP on the organization's management control
   systems.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on a longitudinal
   case study of a North American Financial. Data were collected during the
   deployment of a new management control system. The paper introduces the
   temporal view of agency as a means of examining the practices involved
   in control system.
   Findings - The observations suggest that ERP can create an illusion of
   control, and may jeopardize the systems they are meant-to augment
   through the presence of practices meant to by-pass-the control system
   and invisible work (work-arounds).
   Originality/value - The paper seeks to augment existing studies of
   technology mitigated change through framing the analysis in a temporal
   practice perspective to offer insight into the paths of action
   individuals adopt: the how and why.},

Abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions are a popular method for
   enabling the business processes required to compete in advent of
   globalisation. The textiles industry's global customer base has specific
   cost and availability needs that are forcing suppliers to become more
   sophisticated in the management of manufacturing and where this is
   becoming increasingly dependent upon the successful choice and
   implementation of IT. Case evidence highlights how globalisation
   pressured a firm to align organisation structures with business
   processes and business strategy with IT strategy in order to compete. It
   also shows the complexity that the choice of an ERP solution brings to
   implementation.},

Abstract = {In Shenzhen the quantity of vegetable produced by scattering peasant
   farmer amounts to 95\%. The quality status and security level of
   vegetable is important for citizens. This paper discusses the design and
   realization of vegetable safety traceability and tracking system based
   on the management information system of Shenzhen JIANONG Modem
   Agricultural Development Company which is a loosening internal
   organization. Because the company has its peculiar organizational model
   composed of company and peasant farmers, its information system design
   has its own characters. In recent years, the software of Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) has been applied in some large agricultural
   enterprises. But the software of ERP for medium-sized and smaller
   agricultural enterprise is lacking in the ERP market. Especially in
   these agricultural enterprises whose main business are producing and
   transporting vegetable, there are particular work flow and requirement
   for management information in these agricultural enterprises and
   employees in these enterprises have low quality in education. But about
   all kinds of professional ERP software are for producing enterprises and
   used by employees who must have knowledge of computer and finance. In
   addition the work flow and management of agricultural enterprises are
   not comprehended by software designers. In one hand it is inconvenience
   to handle the security of vegetable in the condition of scattering
   producing vegetable, in the other hand agricultural enterprises also
   wish to control the farmers' producing and improve the quality of
   product. In order to adapt to security of vegetable and satisfy the
   requirement of agricultural enterprises, the software system has been
   designed, which has the function of traceability and tracking for
   vegetable and integrate the function of substance flow management and
   finance information. The software system is composed of two subsystems,
   which are company wholesale market subsystem and producing base
   subsystem. Shenzhen JIANONG Company has adopted the system and acquired
   anticipative result.},

Abstract = {This study investigates customers' evaluation of the offered price
   suggestion for a consumer durable sold under Pay-What-You-Want pricing.
   The relative use of internal reference price (IRP) and external
   reference price (ERP) is examined in customers' price evaluation
   process. This study is a quantitative study employing a scenario-based
   approach to obtain responses from the participants. 208 students
   participated in between-subject factorial experiment design. ANCOVA and
   simple effects analysis were used to assess customers' responses to
   measures like price assessment and perceived price fairness. Results
   show that respondents exhibit the relatively greater influence of ERP
   than IRP in the price evaluation process. This varying effect was
   attributed to two key factors, accessibility of the information and
   diagnostic perceptions.},

Abstract = {Big Data is one of the most important developments in management
   practice today, with McKinsey Global Institute (2011) arguing that it
   will fundamentally change business. Forbes (2013) states that ``the
   market for Big Data will reach \$16.1 billion in 2014, growing 6 times
   faster than the overall information technology (IT) market.'' Given the
   growing significance of Big Data as a business tool, this paper
   considers the extent to which Big Data will be embraced by the audit
   profession and how that usage will evolve over time. I put forward the
   hypothesis that auditors cannot stray too far from the practices of
   their clients since their credibility with and respect of those clients
   are the basis of the value added that they provide. Hence, if Big Data
   becomes an essential business tool, then inevitably it will have the
   same impact on auditing, albeit, perhaps later and with a more muted
   reaction. Analysis also indicates that American and international
   auditing standards, technological advances, and market forces are some
   of the facilitators and obstacles that will determine the use of Big
   Data by auditors and that will shape how that usage will evolve over
   time.},

Abstract = {We develop a new approach to determine investors' risk compensations for
   all distributional moments of a security. Using the concept of entropy,
   which is a summary of all moments of a risky security, we derive the
   relationship between expected returns and their compensation for entropy
   risk. Entropy risk premium (ERP), which is entropy under the physical
   minus the risk-neutral measure, indicates the hedging cost against
   changes in risks associated with all moments of the return's
   distribution. Applying our model to the commodity markets, we find that
   ERP carries economically significant information for the cross-section
   of returns that is different from individual or combined moments. (JEL

Abstract = {Based on a case study of a large Swedish local government municipality,
   we explored the extent to which a cloud-based enterprise resource
   planning (CERP) system enabled the role performance of public sector
   management accountants. Our findings suggest that the CERP system
   enabled central management accountants to mobilize their specific
   expertise because it eliminated manual work, increased transparency, and
   made them feel more comfortable with the numbers. However, the less
   flexible features of a CERP system provided by external vendors, such as
   limited customization, posed a challenge for the local management
   accountants serving the different needs of a diverse range of managers
   and business units. Looking at the different attitudes that central and
   local management accountants developed toward the CERP system, we found
   that although both focal groups in our analysis belonged to the same
   occupation, they framed the role of technology differently. Although
   local management accountants framed it as a tool that should enable them
   to draw on their local expertise to produce tailor-made information for
   their local units, central management accountants saw the CERP system as
   a tool that allowed them to consume prefabricated ``high-quality{''}
   information to assure efficient and risk-free processes throughout the
   entire organization. Given this, cloud technology constitutes a risk
   that accounting and control processes become unduly inflexible and
   cumbersome at the local level. Coping with an inflexible cloud-based
   system may therefore add to the list of challenges that public sector
   management accountants experience when trying to be(come) business
   partners.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a method for estimating the expected duration of
   competitive advantage from emerging technology adoption for the average
   adopting firm. The proposed method relies on publicly available data
   (e.g., web search interest, news articles, book titles, and firm
   disclosures) and integrates elements from diffusion of innovation
   theory, hype cycles, and resource-based view of competitive advantage.
   We validate this method by applying it to two mature technologies,
   namely ERP and cloud computing, for which we come up with estimates
   consistent with findings from prior studies. Leveraging our method,
   researchers and professionals can use readily available data to make
   their own estimations. Such estimates can inform researchers in
   answering research questions related to duration of competitive
   advantage from technology adoption. They can inform professionals in
   making better business decisions such as forecasting the net present
   value of an investment in an emerging technology.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we aim to unpack an organizational phenomenon that is
   often taken for granted: the under-use of management systems. We look at
   one specific management tool: a Customer Relationship Management
   software package whose implementation and usage we monitored over a
   10-year period (2002-2012), in a French company specializing in the
   door-drop advertising market. We build on Actor Network Theory, drawing
   on concepts such as script, interactions between users and technical
   objects (Akrich 2006a, 2006b) and interessement to trace the roots of
   the CRM's under-use.
   We show that the under-use of the CRM is created by three dynamics of
   interessement: a discontinuation of users' interessement, an
   anti-interessement and a short-term interessement creating long-term
   loss of interest. These results allow us to refresh results of previous
   research on vernaculars and on the life cycle of accounting tools.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine continuous monitoring through
   flowcharts at a company that trades on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The
   company uses an ERP system for all its operations, continuous
   monitoring, and continuous auditing activities. The company's continuous
   monitoring activities are analyzed with flowcharts produced after
   examining the processes. Based on these flowcharts, existing control
   points of the company's ERP systems are explained. The flowcharts also
   have new control points that would be applied to the company's system.
   Consequently, by the means of the generated flowcharts, the continuous
   monitoring activities are improved and the continuous auditing system
   will be developed using the proposed new control points in flowcharts.
   Because of the integration of all firm processes such as production,
   purchasing, human resources, marketing, and sales in one flowchart, and
   generation of a monitoring system, this study is important and provides
   a new perspective on the current literature.},

Abstract = {The infusion of technologies such as Internet, Virtual Reality
   (VR)/Animation, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) into business
   operations is drastically evolving the way businesses operate. Customers
   gain more bargaining power than ever through the ubiquity of the
   Internet. Customers demand products with lower prices, higher quality
   and speedy delivery, but they also want products customized to match
   their unique requirement. To meet these demands, companies have to
   evolve their business model from traditional mass production to mass
   customization. Mass customization allows customers to select order and
   receive a specially configured product, often choosing from among
   hundreds of product options, at a low cost, and short lead-time of
   delivery over the Internet. To fully support mass customization in
   e-business, a proposed system that equips with a VR-based product
   configuration module to allow customers specify unique requirements and
   visualizes the resulting product in 3D and an ERP backend support engine
   to provide real-time information on cost and delivery lead-time is
   proposed in this research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},

Number = {2-3},
Month = {APR-MAY},
Abstract = {We explore a large sample of analysts' estimates of the cost of equity
   capital (CoE) to evaluate their usefulness as expected return proxies
   (ERP). We find that the CoE estimates are significantly related to a
   firm's beta, size, book-to-market ratio, leverage, and idio-syncratic
   volatility but not other risk proxies. Even after controlling for the
   popular return predictors, the CoE estimates incrementally predict
   future stock returns. This predictive ability is better explained as the
   CoE estimates containing ERP information rather than reflecting stock
   mispricing. When evaluated against traditional ERPs, including the
   implied costs of capital, the CoE estimates are found to be the least
   noisy. Finally, we document CoE responses around earnings announcements,
   demonstrating their usefulness to study discount-rate reactions of
   market participants. We conclude that analysts' CoE estimates are
   meaningful ERPs that can be fruitfully employed in a variety of asset
   pricing contexts.

   several thousands of transactions daily. This makes it difficult to find
   a few instances of anomalous activities among legitimate transactions.
   Although continuous auditing and continuous monitoring systems perform
   substantial analytics, they often produce lengthy reports that require
   painstaking post-analysis. Approaches that reduce the burden of
   excessive information are more likely to contribute to the overall
   effectiveness of the audit process. The authors address this issue by
   designing and testing the use of visualization methods to present
   information graphically, to assist auditors in detecting anomalous and
   potentially fraudulent accounts payable transactions. The strength of
   the authors' approach is its capacity for discovery and recognition of
   new and unexpected insights.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained from the SAP enterprise
   ( ERP) system of a real-world organization. A framework for performing
   visual analytics was developed and applied to the data to determine its
   usefulness and effectiveness in identifying anomalous activities.
   Findings - The paper provides valuable insights into understanding the
   use of different types of visualizations to effectively identify
   anomalous activities.
   Research limitations/implications - Because this study emphasizes asset
   misappropriation, generalizing these findings to other categories of
   fraud, such as accounts receivable, must be made with caution.
   Practical implications - This paper provides a framework for developing
   an automated visualization solution which may have implications in
   practice.
   Originality/value - This paper demonstrates the need to understand the
   effectiveness of visualizations in detecting accounting fraud. This is
   directly applicable to organizations investigating methods of improving
   fraud detection in their ERP systems.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to explore the complex, multi-level institutional
   dynamics of smart city reforms and projects and their potential
   sustainability pressures on the implementation of a management
   accounting system in an Egyptian state-owned enterprise (SOE), which has
   a politically sensitive institutional character.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study adds to institutional management accounting research using a
   multi-level perspective of institutional dynamics in the smart city
   context. Data were collected from an interpretive case study of an
   Egyptian SOE that was under socio-political sustainability pressures to
   implement a smart electricity network project in New Minya city.
   Findings
   Smart city projects have formed social and political sustainability
   pressures, which introduced the enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   network as a new management accounting system. A new (complex and
   multi-level) management accounting system was invented to reinvent the
   sustainable city as an ``accounting city{''} (which appeared
   rhetorically as a ``smart city{''}). ``Smart{''} being the visibility
   and measurability of the sustainability performance of the collective
   body, which calls the city and its connectivity to different
   institutional levels brought out in a city network project for the
   ERP-enabled electricity distribution.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study examines a single case study from a single smart city and
   identifies the accounting community's need for multiple and comparative
   case studies to further analyse the potential impact of smart city
   reforms and projects on the sustainable implementation of management
   accounting systems.
   Practical implications
   City policymakers and managers may benefit from the practical findings
   of this interpretive field-based case study in planning, implementing
   and monitoring smart city projects and objectives.
   Social implications
   Individual and collective well-being may be enhanced through new
   management accounting forms of multi-level local governance and
   increased political, field and organisational sustainability.
   Originality/value
   This study provides important insights into the sustainability dynamics
   of management accounting in achieving smart city reforms. The
   achievement of sustainability management accounting systems has
   connected to multiple ERP roles at different institutional levels, which
   resulted in accommodating the socio-political objectives of smart city
   projects.},

Abstract = {The growing number of crisis situations around the world in recent years
   has highlighted the urgent need to improve the capability of Emergency
   Response Systems. When an emergency happens, the most important response
   is to promptly evacuate victims or potential victims from dangerous
   areas to safe places. The use of decision support systems can not only
   improve the efficiency of evacuation but also reduce losses on life and
   property. But existing computer-based decision support systems mainly
   aim at simplifying the evacuation process. The evacuation plans produced
   by them are difficult to follow and Emergency Response Personnel (ERP)
   cannot readily access emergency evacuation information in real time. In
   this paper, we present Blue Arrow, a web-based spatially-enabled
   decision support system for emergency evacuation planning. Based on
   their specific requirements, ERP can use the Blue Arrow System to
   generate various evacuation plans that have intuitive turn-by-turn
   instructions. These evacuation plans depend not only on the spatial
   information, but also on the underlying road network information. The
   Blue Arrow System implements different evacuation plans using the
   different variants of CCRP algorithm that focus on optimizing various
   aspects of the evacuation planning process including evacuation time and
   capacity.},

Title = {INNOVATIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT},
Journal = {ACADEMY REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Number = {2},
Pages = {98-110},
Abstract = {The development and implementation of the latest technologies requires
   certain changes in the management of enterprises, organizations and
   banks that seek to be competitive in the market.
   Many studies state that enterprises and organizations that are flexible
   and quickly adapt to changes in the external environment, quickly
   improve management, taking into account all approaches and methods, are
   successful in the market and successfully adapt to changes.
   Financial management in enterprises, organizations and banks through
   processes that enable effective management is an important and rather
   complex issue. It should be noted that in Ukraine, the improvement of
   financial management through the use of the latest technologies, such
   as, for example, digitalization, is not very active. At the same time,
   most enterprises in developed countries demonstrate examples of the
   implementation of various innovative financial management tools. These
   and other important questions need to be explored.
   In the scientific article, the analysis of information software, which
   is the most common in use, is carried out, their distinguishing
   characteristics are given, and the expediency of introducing innovative
   information technologies into the financial management system of
   domestic enterprises, organizations, financial and banking institutions
   to automate the planning and forecasting process is justified. The
   experience of 25 foreign industries that use information software was
   considered, and those that are most popular among foreign enterprises
   were determined.
   The authors considered the most prevailing in use foreign software,
   which can be used by domestic companies, provided the distinctive
   characteristics of such software and cited the examples of foreign
   companies that have already had experience in using the specified
   programs to automate the planning and forecasting process. The
   experience of 25 foreign industries was examined in this regard.
   There was created a comparison matrix between functions of the foreign
   software for automation of the processes of financial planning and
   forecasting: functions of the planning process, forecasting, reporting,
   and conducting analytics. Based on the results of the analysis, foreign
   software for automation of the planning and forecasting processes at
   enterprises was ranked according to four criteria: general rating, ease
   of use, quality of support, and ease of configuration.
   Special attention was paid to the most modem new generation business
   platform for financial planning and forecasting called Oracle Enterprise
   Performance Management (EPM) System, its modules were considered and
   advantages in practical use were determined.
   The list of the most popular information programs that can be used by
   domestic enterprises, organizations, and financial and banking
   institutions for effective financial management was given. These are BAS
   ERP, SAP ERP, ``Galaxy ERP{''}, SyteLine. ``Parus ERP{''}, Oracle E-
   business Suit, and Microsoft Dynamics AX. Conclusions and proposals were
   made regarding the implementation of information technologies for the
   purpose of effective financial management of domestic enterprises,
   organizations, and financial and banking institutions.},

Abstract = {The appearance and development of e-business brings great impact on
   every industry. It also brings profound revolution in construction
   enterprises' management ideas and patterns. The traditional framework of
   construction enterprise management information system (MIS) is
   challenged by the change. Using e-business in construction enterprises
   is a necessary tide of them development both of information and
   construction enterprises themselves.
   This paper firstly summarizes the current situation of e-business, then
   analyzes the disadvantages of traditional MIS models, and discusses the
   new functions of construction enterprises MIS for e-business. Based on
   the thoughts of integrating the information of all partners' and also
   integrating the information technique with operation flow in
   construction enterprises, this paper builds up a e-business-oriented MIS
   model that includes interior data flow on Intranet and exterior data
   flow on Internet. Modem management ideas and methods such as Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP), life circle management, total management and
   supply chain management are used. Finally, it analyzes the design of
   ERP, project management system, supply chain management system and
   business intelligence system, the integration among the subsystems and
   data integration between enterprise MIS and the relevant exterior
   platforms. The research will be very useful to the successful use of
   e-business in construction enterprises and approving their core
   competence fundamentally.},

Abstract = {Unlike big companies, financial management activities of SMEs are quite
   limited in terms of spatial scope. They have relatively small amount of
   capital flow and stock. The development of information technology has
   gradually evolved network into a brand-new business model, which has
   spread into financial management of SMEs. The coordination effect,
   complementary effect, real-time effect, and leverage effect of network
   have imposed profound and far-reaching impacts on financial management
   models of SMEs. So there are ERP model and ASP model can be selected.},

Abstract = {Mass Customization (MC) is an emerging manufacturing mode with great
   prospect. It is a different production mode from Mass Production. This
   paper discusses the applicability of PPC (Production Planning and
   Controlling) approaches to the Mass Customization production
   environment. Firstly, some classic PPC approaches, such as MRP, MRPII,
   ERP, JIT and OPT are discussed. Secondly, a new PPC method - - WLC
   (Workload Control) is introduced. Finally, the paper concludes that
   among all the PPC approaches, WLC is a suitable framework to deal with
   production planning and controlling in Mass Customization.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, management and financial accounting were two relatively
   independent information systems. Recent progress in the business
   environment of developed countries leads to a gradual intergrowth of
   these two originally separate systems into one integrated structure.
   Specific situation occurs in transitional countries in the Central and
   Eastern Europe. Financial reporting of these countries is heavily
   influenced by tax legislation, which impairs the usefulness of financial
   statements for external users. Entities are forced to remove those lacks
   in management accounting in a great extent to obtain useful information
   for the internal decision-making. A separate coexistence of management
   and financial accounting is then inevitable. The IFRS adoption has
   increased the quality of financial reporting in transitional countries,
   despite significant implementation costs. To lower the cost burden, the
   IFRS are becoming the leading principles of management accounting. The
   paper assumes that the IFRS may be a special driver for the convergence
   of financial and management accounting in transitional countries and
   supports this assumption by empirical questionnaire survey among
   selected Czech companies.},

   framework for applying the in-memory columnar database systems to
   support high-speed continuous audit analytics. To evaluate the proposed
   framework, this study develops a prototype and conducts simulation
   tests. The test results show high computational efficiency and
   effectiveness of the inmemory columnar database relative to the
   conventional ERP system. Furthermore, the deployment of the in-memory
   columnar database to the cloud shows the promise of scaling up the
   in-memory columnar database for continuous audit analytics.},

Abstract = {Compliance-driven investments in technology-or ``RegTech{''}-are growing
   rapidly. To understand the effects on the financial sector, we study
   firms' responses to new internal control requirements. Affected firms
   make significant investments in ERP and hardware. These expenditures
   then enable complementary investments that are leveraged for
   noncompliance purposes, leading to modest savings from avoided customer
   complaints and misconduct. IT budgets rise and profits fall, especially
   at small firms, and acquisition activity and market concentration
   increase. Our results illustrate how regulation can directly and
   indirectly affect technology adoption, which in turn affects
   noncompliance functions and market structure.},

Title = {The predictive ability of the bond-stock earnings yield differential
   model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {63+},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors survey the bond-stock prediction model for
   five worldwide equity markets. This model is useful for predicting the
   time-varying equity risk premium (ERP) and for strategic asset
   allocation of bond-stock equity mixes. The focus is on the model's
   economic and financial implications and its application to the study of
   stock market strategies and corrections. The model has two versions. The
   first model, formulated more than 35 years ago by Ziemba and Schwartz,
   is the difference between the most liquid long bond, usually the 10- or
   30-year bond, and the trailing equity yield. The idea is that asset
   allocation between stocks and bonds is related to their relative yields.
   When the bond yield is too high, a shift out of stocks into bonds can
   cause an equity market correction. This model predicted the 1987 2000,
   and 2002 corrections in the United States and the 1;90 correction in
   Japan. The second model and equivalent version, the Fed model, uses the
   ratio, or equivalently the logs, of the two yields, and has its origins
   in reports and statements from the Federal Reserve System under Alan
   Greenspan dating from about 1996. The ERP can thus be negative or
   positive and is, therefore, partially predictable. Despite its
   predictive ability, the bond-stock model has been criticized as being
   theoretically unsound because it compares a nominal quantity (the
   long-bond yield) with a real quantity (the earnings yield on stocks).
   Theoretical models of fairly priced equity indices can be derived and
   compared to actual index values to ascertain danger levels.},

Abstract = {This article presents three exercises that introduce the applications of
   robotic process automation (RPA) for accounting tasks. The objective of
   these exercises is to provide undergraduate accounting students with an
   introduction to RPA that provides hands-on practice during class time.
   The three exercises cover a wide range of RPA applications, including
   logging into an ERP system, extracting data from the internet, and
   entering information from Excel to PDF. We have developed three
   hands-on, step-by-step exercises using UiPath as the software of choice.
   We also provide guidance and Teaching Notes regarding how to implement
   the three exercises in an undergraduate accounting information systems
   (AIS) course.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this paper was to analyze the enterprise
   information system in a selected organization, summarizing the benefits
   and identifying the deficits of the system, followed up by a proposal of
   system changes with the aim to compensate the identified deficits.
   Firstlyit is necessary to present theoretical perspective on the topic:
   defining what an enterprise information system is, outlining the types
   of enterprise information systems, and describing a life cycle of an
   enterprise information system. Next, there is described environment of
   the enterprise information system, its implementation, as well as the
   enterprise information system itself - hardware, software, people, and
   processes. In the last part of this paper we are dealing with the
   proposal of the optimization of the IS and its selection. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The current research illustrates a framework for modeling the bankruptcy
   prediction models using the Unified Modeling Language. The developed
   framework uses the Anghel bankruptcy prediction model which is ranked by
   the local specialists as one of the most representative and actual
   autochthonous model. Also, our decision regarding the modeling of Anghel
   bankruptcy prediction function was based on the high accuracy rate of
   the model which is higher that 95\%. Thus, through the UML modeling of
   the Anghel function it was intended to highlight the extent to which
   current economic transactions, carried out within the company (sales,
   purchasing, commissioning), submit through accounting operations (which
   supplies the balance of accounts) items in the annual financial
   statements information that determines the final score of Anghel
   function. Due to such application, any company could be able to find out
   at any moment the Anghel score value and hence the company's financial
   status (which can be either financial stability or bankruptcy risk).
   Owning such information could be vital for the company because, in the
   case of financial instability warning, the top management will have a
   sufficient margin of time to bring the activity to a healthy state and
   thus to prevent the bankruptcy settlement. Furthermore, the current UML
   developed model can be acquired by a add-on computer application and
   integrated into an ERP system within a Business Intelligence Component
   or a Scorecard component/module. Through such integration, the
   application will benefit from the computerization of other ERP modules
   from which will be able to retrieve information regarding the account
   balances. Such information is necessary to determine the cumulative,
   multi-level hierarchical Z-score value function as presented in our
   detailed UML model. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {This study provides the first large-scale study of the performance of
   expected-return proxies (ERPs) internationally. Analyst-forecast-based
   ICCs are sparsely populated and not robustly associated with future
   returns. Earnings-model-forecast-based ICCs are well-populated, but are
   unreliable outside the U.S. We adapt and extend the log-linear and
   present-value (LPV) framework-combining an accounting valuation anchor,
   its expected growth, and market prices-for estimating ERPs
   internationally, and implement a correction for the use of stale
   accounting data. An LPV ERP anchored on the book value of equity is
   positively associated with future returns in 26 of 29 equity markets,
   and largely subsumes the predictive ability of a broad set of firm
   characteristics previously shown to be associated with expected returns.},

Abstract = {Early enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems or, more simply,
   enterprise systems (ES), were not primarily focused on the supply chain.
   Their initial focus was to execute and integrate such
   internally-oriented applications that support finance, accounting,
   manufacturing, order entry, and human resources. Having got their
   internal operations somewhat integrated, many organizations have moved
   on to address the supply chain with their ES. The Internet has also
   brought about a revolution in supply chain thinking. Progress toward
   complete inter-enterprise integration is measured in years and even
   decades. In this article, we discuss both the visions firms have for
   using enterprise systems for supply chain management, and the actual
   reality of current implementation. We conclude with projections of how
   enterprise systems will be used for supply chains in the future.},

Abstract = {The existing SCM software products in China are not relatively perfect
   in aspects: real-time visibility, flexibility, response ability, and
   development speed. This paper studies Distribution Resource Planning
   system from management idea, application model and technical tool
   aspects, integrating latest SCM ideas and information technologies. The
   innovative SCM software system developed includes supply chain process
   and event management capabilities. It has higher visibility and response
   ability to enhance the predictability of decision-making, provides a new
   and minimum Total Cost Of Ownership solution of business management, and
   adapts to the complex changes in the competitive environment. The system
   is designed basing on Web and J2EE. UML Java, XML and Internet/Intranet

Abstract = {Reconciliation of transactions between multiple parties is a
   time-consuming process. This paper presents a new conceptual framework
   that may lower costs and shorten the reconciliation time. The proposed
   framework recommends recording transactions on the blockchain before
   populating the transacting parties' respective enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) systems, which will be the source of a single truth. This
   information flow will result in all involved parties having access to
   the same transaction details. Further, the paper presents a technical
   feasibility demonstration with two examples, where all involved parties
   are executing transaction details on the blockchain after meeting the
   governing smart contract constraints using their digital wallets. The
   new conceptual framework has been specifically designed to create one
   truth for all parties involved in a transaction that in turn may
   eliminate what is perceived to be unnecessary redundancy in current
   accounting systems.},

Abstract = {RFID middleware is a new class of software. While the rapid growth in
   developing and applying RFID technology, the RFID middleware is
   imminently needed. In this paper, we design a RFID middleware platform,
   which uses the net technology, agent technology and Information
   processing technology, to integrate and manage different RFID readers or
   many kinds of standards. It must be capable of processing large amounts
   of data, rectifying errors in real-time, reorganizing and scrubbing data
   and recovering from faults and exceptions. The finally purpose of this
   RFID middleware is the integration with the existing information system,
   e.g. ERP, CRM, PDM and so on, through the service-oriented architecture,
   which is based on the middleware. In this paper, a new Architecture of
   an intelligent RFID middleware is presented, and also put forward a
   service-oriented architecture which is based on the middleware.},

Pages = {125-145},
Abstract = {Robotic process automation (RPA) provides organizations numerous
   benefits in achieving efficiency and effectiveness, but not without
   risks. Without proper management, the risks posed by RPA may outweigh
   its intended benefits. RPA risk management has received little attention
   in prior accounting research and in practice. We discuss risks and
   control considerations important to achieving the return on RPA
   investment and maintaining the integrity of the automated processes. We
   substantiate our discussion by interviewing RPA and risk professionals.
   Our interviewees suggest that RPA risk management provides incremental
   value in addition to risk management of Enterprise Resource Planning
   (ERP) systems, that the skillset needed for RPA risk management may be
   missing among risk professionals, and that existing risk and control
   frameworks need to evolve for RPA risk management. Our discussion
   stimulates future research and helps organizations as they begin to
   consider RPA risk management.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the political uproar over offshore outsourcing
   connected with the release of the Economic Report of the President (ERP)
   in February 2004, examines the differing ways in which economists and
   non-economists talk about offshore outsourcing, and assesses the
   empirical evidence on the importance of offshore outsourcing in
   accounting for the weak labor market from 2001 to 2004. Even with
   important gaps in the data, the empirical literature is able to conclude
   that offshore outsourcing is unlikely to have accounted for a meaningful
   part of the job losses in the recent downturn or contributed much to the
   slow labor market rebound. The empirical evidence to date, while still
   tentative, actually suggests that increased employment in the overseas
   affiliates of US multinationals is associated with more employment in
   the US parent rather than less. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This study explores the use of audit data analytics (ADA) in current
   audit practice. First, we interviewed the heads of professional practice
   of five international public accounting firms in Norway. We find that
   they differ in strategies on how to implement ADA and the heads report
   significant uncertainty about the supervisory inspection authorities'
   response to the use of ADA. Second, we administered a questionnaire to
   216 engagement partners and managers about their perceptions of ADA and
   their actual ADA use on 109 audit engagements. Overall, the attitudes
   toward ADA usefulness are positive. Analysis of the audit engagements
   suggests use of ADA is relatively limited and use of more ``advanced{''}
   ADA is rare. More ADA are used for clients with integrated ERP/IT
   systems and for newly tendered audit engagements. We also provide
   details of ADA use on each phase of the audit. We discuss our findings
   from an institutional theory perspective.},

Abstract = {The pressure for shorter product life cycles, improved quality,
   increased variety and increased competition that face today's
   manufacturing businesses create a relentless pressure for change and
   consequently the need for companies to stay abreast of the latest
   development in world best practices.
   One area of work that serves to integrate a number of best practices is
   the area of supply chain management (SCM). SCM is the management of
   materials and information flows both within and between facilities which
   occurs in the context of procurement, manufacturing, sales, distribution
   of goods, information and services across the entire supply chain (SC).
   The integration of configuration systems for supporting SCM of
   configurable products and services is still an open research issue. The
   importance of SCM is generally recognized. In this paper I argue that
   system development is now entering a new phase of maturity with the
   advent of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software packages, and
   a new software concept. Future research opportunities are outlined.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing consensus that global excess saving' has
   contributed to a reduction in equilibrium real interest rates. While
   economists dispute the extent of the decline, few now question that a
   decline has taken place or that excess saving has played a causal role.
   A key implication of this narrative is a decline in yields of all
   assets, including but not restricted to government bond yields. Yet,
   since the turn of the century, yields on global equity have risen. A
   complementary explanation is that there has been an increase in the
   global equity risk premium (ERP), which has simultaneously pushed
   risk-free yield curves lower and equity yields higher. Applying a sign
   restrictions approach, I find that excess savings shocks were the
   predominant force affecting global real bond yields between the
   mid-1980s and 2000 but that risk premium' shocks have accounted for more
   of the decline in real bond yields since 2000.},

Abstract = {Financial reporting has evolved over centuries in distinct stages. The
   first reports (Reporting 1.0) were the trial balances ensuring that
   debits equaled credits, using the terminology popularized by Pacioli.
   The next major innovation was formalized in the Great Depression, with
   Reporting 2.0 being the standardized and audited financial statements.
   Reporting 3.0 evolved as technology was used to augment that reporting
   process with ERP-based data and XBRL. Today, technology is still relying
   on the automation of existing processes in Reporting 3.0. This paper
   proposes the move to Reporting 4.0, where technology will change
   reporting as fundamentally as Industry 4.0 is changing business
   operations. What characterizes Reporting 4.0 is the application of the
   intelligence inherent in 21st-century technology to create an app-based
   reporting system characterized by mass customization: the ability for
   reports to be tailored to meet the needs of the heterogeneous
   stakeholder community of the multi-objective modern enterprise.},

Abstract = {The most recent economic crisis forced western companies to cut their IT
   budgets. This was possible in many cases by outsourcing IT projects in
   countries like Romania. For Romanian Information Systems graduates
   outsourcing has steeply increased the job offer. But it also changed the
   required skills (competencies) ratio between technical and business
   issues. When crises erupted a lot of ERP projects had been launched but
   since then only a few have been completed and recently vet)) few have
   been initiated. New IS jobs require more technical skills and urge for
   curricula recalibration. This paper presents some preliminary results of
   a survey conducted in 2013 and 2015 for the graduates of IS master
   programme at Al.I.Cuza University of Iasi. The survey main objectives
   were to identify the required skills on the IT market, graduates opinion
   about the programme, including curricula, syllabi, internship,
   infrastructure, teaching staff, and program strengths and weaknesses and
   re-align curricula to the industry demand.},

Abstract = {IT outsourcing is one of the most frequently met action by SMEs in the
   USA, Australia and Western Europe but, in this respect, Romania is still
   at the beginning. Regardless of company size, both the structure and
   functionality of IT systems are much the same, so the main components
   that SMEs outsource, are: the Internet connection (with sub-web services
   such as e-mail, browsing), IT infrastructure: hardware component
   (including servers, workstations, printers, scanners, UPS's) as well as
   software component that includes a wide range of specialized
   applications, and also generalized systems such as ERP (Business
   Management),CRM (Customer Management), SCM (Supply Chain Management),
   applications for data backup and internal communication. Therefore,
   within the current research it is our endeavor to identify the IT areas
   that are fertile for service outsourcing, highlight the future trends,
   identify the advantages and disadvantages that comes along with the IT
   outsourcing process and what is Romanian SMEs interest in IT
   outsourcing. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {We examine private investors' funding preferences for cloud computing
   start-ups that provide services in various information technology (IT)
   areas. The funding preference is measured in funding size and frequency.
   Using data from CrunchBase, an unconventional dynamic database, we find
   significantly positive associations between the funding preference and
   the cloud computing services provided in IT security, and Big Data and
   data analytics among cloud computing start-ups that have received at
   least two rounds of funding. The association is negatively significant
   when the cloud computing services are provided in ERP systems and when
   the funding preference is measured only in size. The results suggest
   that private investors differentiate among start-ups by specific
   technology and the lifecycle of the technology. During the sample period
   of rapid growth in the cloud computing industry, we document that the
   funding preference by private investors favors start-ups that provide
   services in critical, newer, and fast-growing IT areas.},

Abstract = {Despite massive investments in ERP, CRM, and other enterprise systems,
   many small \& medium businesses (SMBs) still don't have the information
   they need to make good business decisions. The problem isn't a lack of
   information - it's a lack of insight. Today's decision-makers are buried
   in raw data and reports, but the truly useful insights are hidden
   somewhere in the pile. With the development of IT and management
   innovation, more and more SMBs are starting to close the insight gap
   through a practice called Integrated Performance Management (IPM). In
   this paper, a business model of integrated performance management for

Abstract = {An efficient supply chain management embedded with latest technology is
   the key for the success of any global organization. While the efficiency
   of the managers throughout the supply chain is not to be under
   estimated, it has been proved time and again that those managers who
   adopt or even create technology to enhance their supply chain operations
   have achieved outstanding results. The invention of internet and
   following IT technologies has been the foundation for the evolution of
   supply chain management. The aim of this study is to review major
   technologies that emerged to facilitate supply chain management. Among
   some of the significant technologies that retailers around the globe use
   for their business processes are Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP),
   Warehouse Management System (WMS), Transportation Management System
   (TMS) and Automatic Identification and Data Collection (AIDC). Some
   customer based technologies in use are Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI),
   Point of Sale (POS) and Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and
   Replenishment (CPFR), etc. The recent developments in RFID technologies
   have opened doors for major applications in the field of SCM. This paper
   will consider few impact making technologies and discuss their
   applications, benefits and how they sustained the challenges of SCM.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, to be able to stay in competitive environment, organizations
   have understood, that implementing an ERP system it's the best condition
   for a sustainable business. Many companies in Romania have become
   branches of large companies in the world. In order to manage these
   companies, they had to adapt their IT solutions to the standard imposed
   by the mother company in order to monitoring of enterprise processes and
   factory floor is one of the ways to achieve better efficiency,
   performance and overview. As consequence of several frameworks, a lot of
   methodologies were proposed, rollout being one of them. The rollout
   solution was adopted by the Romanian company for which this case study
   was made. We will look at the difficulties encountered by SAP
   consultants in discussions with the Romanian business environment in the
   context of the rollout case adaptation of Poland and Slovakia. All cases
   encountered during the project run, as well as the proposed solutions,
   will be analysed. However, the amount of different available solutions
   provides difficulties to make right decisions. In conclusion, part of
   this case study, we have achieved an implementation model, which makes
   implementation the successful one.},

Abstract = {With the growth of the business world, autonomous software programs such
   as MRP, ERP, and SAP have been used to synchronize different units and
   departments since the 1960s. There have been great technological
   developments in the last decades, such as Blockchain, the Internet of
   Things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The attention of
   the accounting world has also been on those technological developments,
   especially on Blockchain Technology. Accounting academics and
   professionals have been trying to understand how blockchain technology
   can affect accounting and what kind of changes might be brought about by
   that technology. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to make a
   systematic literature review in order to foresee the potential effects
   of blockchain on accounting. Selected keywords were searched for on the
   Scopus database. The results show that most of the studies in this area
   focus on technical issues and the development of software applications,
   and a small number of studies make a connection between blockchain and
   accounting. Although most of the authors are very optimistic about
   blockchain technology and claim that this technology may change the
   double-entry accounting system completely and radically, some have
   discrete approach and express critical views.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the degree to which multinational enterprises (MNEs)
   use information technology for managing international transfer pricing
   (ITP). Based on 21 interviews conducted with in-house accounting and tax
   professionals in MNEs, we observed limited use of information technology
   for ITP management. However, some degree of ITP automation was observed
   in workflow management to produce transfer pricing documentation. The
   limited degree of automation observed was driven by both system- and
   individual-level barriers. Overall, we found that management accountants
   and information technology experts dominate the enterprise resource
   planning system design agenda, and the tax departments' ITP tax
   compliance objective plays a relatively limited role. This reduces the
   ability for ITP automation partly because the data segmentation that is
   prioritized for management reporting does not support the tax
   departments' needs for legal-entity data segmentation to document tax
   compliance.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to study the institutional logics of how
   and why two case units in the Finnish Defence Forces have reacted
   differently to external pressures originating from the State Audit
   Office to change their management accounting systems. The situation is
   made complex due to the fact that in military organisations,
   accountants' tasks have traditionally consisted of bookkeeping and
   financial reporting, while management accounting tasks especially (e.g.
   planning and control) have been performed predominantly by military
   personnel, who can be called hybrid accountants. The data for this study
   consists of project memos and interviews with people involved in
   designing and implementing enterprise-resource-planning (ERP)-linked
   cost accounting and reporting systems. In the case unit where management
   accounting and control had become institutionalised as a part of the
   uniformed officer's professional sphere, various resistance strategies
   (i.e. compromise strategy/pacifying tactics, avoidance
   strategy/buffering tactics and defiance strategy/dismissing tactics)
   were adopted. However, where this was not the case, the response was
   acquiescence. Despite the differences in responses to institutional
   pressure, the outcome for management accounting was the same. In the
   first case, demands for change were resisted, and in the second case,
   the old management accounting system was transferred into new
   information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure without
   any significant change in content.},

Abstract = {In the past 25 years various information instruments for environmental
   management have been developed. Some of them focus on the production
   process and hence can be called ``process oriented{''}. The most
   important process-oriented instruments are corporate input-output
   balance, Environmental Performance Indicators and methods of flow cost
   accounting. They are described and compared in this paper. Benefits for
   the use of the different instruments are shown. For a continuous use of
   Environmental Accounting Instruments in day-to-day environmental
   management, these instruments need to be supported with modern
   information technologies. This paper shows IT strategies on how to
   integrate Environmental Accounting functionalities into a Business
   Information System, which are discussed and partly supported by results
   from two surveys. The benefit of a structured approach to develop and
   integrate Environmental Accounting functionalities into a Business
   Information System is shown. A process model for the IT implementation
   of Environmental Accounting instruments taking into account the
   integration into existing business software is presented based on the
   prototype model. The nine phases of the model are described and
   discussed. A case study at the glass manufacturing company SCHOTT Glas
   shows how Environmental Performance Indicator Systems can be implemented
   in SAP R/3 and in ERP Systems in general. The findings presented here
   are results from the research project INTUS1.},

Abstract = {It is claimed that the re-engineering and automation of routine work
   should free accountants to adopt broader, so-called `value-adding' roles
   as partners to business decision-makers. The `new world of work',
   involving new process-based methods, single instance ERP systems and the
   wholesale relocation of professional work to lower cost areas, brings
   opportunities for accountants in systems design and adding value to the
   business. For many others, the new reality may be a more competitive and
   less secure working environment, with a mid-level career bottleneck
   reflecting a polarisation between the upper and lower layers of the
   finance function.
   Based upon Schein's theory of career anchors and using exploratory
   sequential mixed methods, we consider the impact on the career
   perceptions of individual accountants as accounting expertise,
   traditionally embodied in people, is codified and embedded within
   end-to-end business processes in the context of a finance shared service
   centre. Key findings include new perceptions of careers with greater
   emphasis on the acquisition of general managerial competence and
   leadership skills, with the importance of cultivating a sense of `global
   connectedness' to maintain individual employability. Suggestions are
   made to update Schein's Career Orientation Inventory to better reflect
   the reality of accounting in the `new world of work'. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {We start to build a programme aiming at creating an online laboratory
   for obtaining practical experience in professional accounting to enable
   students to develop an understanding of the business environment and
   relate the acquired knowledge and skills to accounting and financial
   practices and to develop professional judgment, analysis and
   problem-solving skills.
   The initiative is an integral part of Europe 2020 Strategy, where
   stimulating entrepreneurship, creating conditions for development of
   microenterprises, as well as improving the human capital quality are the
   tools to be used to fight unemployment. Studies on the business world's
   real needs have inspired the scientific circles, including the
   University of Warsaw's Faculty of Economic Sciences, to initiate and
   develop such teaching programmes that would provide students of various
   universities and faculties - not only economic - with an opportunity to
   gain practical experience in running a microenterprise, with a special
   focus on accounting, which is often fundamental to success in business.
   The article presents learning projects being implemented by the
   University of Warsaw and based on the international e-learning platform
   FASTER (Financial and Accounting Seminars Targeting European Regions).
   We are proposing ways how the platform could be developed further and
   how it could integrate new forms of teaching students towards
   entrepreneurship, such as ERP, illustrating business operations with
   real accounting documents, process approach and IT modelling and process
   analysis tools.},

Abstract = {Following the 1929 Wall Street collapse, the initial response to the
   institutional failures and collapsing financial system was to allow the
   markets to self-correct, which led to a significant period of economic
   depression. In contrast the US (and UK) governments responded to the
   2008 financial crisis with extra liquidity for the banking sector and a
   stimulus package, but why was there such a different response? Following
   a light touch approach to Bear Stearns and Lehmann's, it became clear
   that without greater intervention, the effect would become contagious
   throughout the financial system. One of the most important forms of
   intervention was Quantitative Easing (QE) and historically low interest
   rates. This study finds that QE substantially reduced the Equity Risk
   Premium on S\&P equities through a 9.6\% rise in prices, thus reducing
   returns. Consequentially, this drives portfolios to seek risker asset
   classes to make up for the shortfall in returns. This suggests that the
   combination of low interest rates and QE, when compared to expansion
   alone, has had a marked change on equity prices and ERP. Furthermore,
   there is evidence that regime shifts support these findings. Such
   unforeseen consequences in the equity markets is of great interest to
   policy makers when deciding on a response to such exceptional
   circumstances, and researchers investigating monetary policy responses
   to the next inevitable extreme financial crisis.},

Abstract = {In this research we established the impact of information technologies
   on the Romanian companies' accounting department. We distributed
   questionnaires in two different moments in time: 2007 and 2014 (before
   and after the economic crisis). Our investigation focuses on: (i) the
   types of technologies used, (ii) the reasons of implementation of
   specific technologies, (iii) the benefits brought by the use of IT, (iv)
   the difficulties met during the implementation process and (v) the
   future effects of the IT. We came to the conclusion that there is a
   change in the degree of implementation of the information technologies
   in the Romanian enterprises. Previous studies show a varied range of
   benefits generated by IT, but also a great number of difficulties
   generated by their adoption. In this research, we followed the manner in
   which the different types of IT influence the activity of the persons
   employed in the accounting departments of the companies functioning in
   Romania. We pursued all the aspects which have to be taken into account
   by a person who decides to implement technologies: the way the company
   obtained IT (by purchasing them or by developing them within the
   company), the types of application used within the accounting department
   (an ERP system or independent applications), the expected benefits, the
   difficulties encountered, the future effects which can be exploited.},

Title = {Making business partners:: A case study on how management accounting
   culture was changed},
Journal = {EUROPEAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-142},
Abstract = {There has been a lot of debate on the new business-oriented role of
   management accountants during recent years. This paper examines how a
   case company is trying to change its management accounting culture in
   practice. Furthermore, it illustrates how accounting practices are woven
   into the cultural fabric of an organization and the great diversity of
   practices constituting its business orientation. This longitudinal case
   study explores and theorizes the multiple cultural change interventions
   related to management accounting, including how the case company
   reorganized the management accounting organization, implemented new
   accounting systems and innovations, pursued a new kind of human resource
   management (recruitment, training and career planning policies) and set
   the official corporate values in order to support this change. The
   deepened decentralization of the business controller function, combined
   with the effective and increasingly centralized basic accounting systems
   (such as ERP and consolidation packages) and HRM management, were of
   high importance in establishing the new business orientation. Moreover,
   informal interventions such as the role modelling and directing of
   personal attention - carried out by the top management and top financial
   executives - and storytelling, contributed to the constitution of
   cultural practices. Thus, the potential power of these informal change
   interventions and mechanisms should not be underestimated, with further
   research being, in fact, in great need. As its major theoretical
   development, at the end of the report, this study introduces a
   systematic framework of the cultural change interventions related to
   management accounting.},

Abstract = {Process mining aims to extract knowledge from the event logs maintained
   by a company's ERP system. The objective of this paper is to make the
   case for why internal and external auditors should leverage the
   capabilities process mining offers to rethink how auditing is carried
   out. We do so by identifying the sources of value added of process
   mining when applied to auditing, which are as follows: 1. process mining
   analyzes the entire population of data and not just a sample; 2.
   critically that data consists of meta-data-data entered independently of
   the actions of auditee-and not just data entered by the auditee; 3
   process mining allows the auditor to have a more effective way of
   implementing the audit risk model by providing effective ways of
   conducting the required walkthroughs of processes and conducting
   analytic procedures; 4. process mining allows the auditor to conduct
   analyses not possible with existing audit tools, such as discovering the
   ways in which business processes are actually being carried out in
   practice, and to identify social relationships between individuals. It
   is our argument that these sources of value have not been fully
   understood in the process mining literature, which has focused on
   developing it as a statistical methodology rather than on applying it to
   audit practice. Only when auditors and audit researchers appreciate what
   is new and unique about process mining will its acceptance in auditing
   practice become feasible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present research paper analyzes the results collected by a survey
   conducted in 2012 in Poland and Bulgaria. The purpose of conducting such
   a survey was at first place to identify which teaching tools and methods
   are considered to be most useful in the process of teaching accounting
   using the e-learning platform and secondly to test and estimate the
   gained accounting knowledge among four target groups: students, people
   interested in vocational trainings, academics in accounting and
   employers from the two countries.
   The reason to conduct the survey in Poland and Bulgaria, was to compare
   results among groups in different circumstances such as educational
   curricula in the area of accounting, tax system and law stability,
   national accounting laws and regulations and their relation to
   international financial reporting standards (IFRS). Moreover, the
   results of the survey allowed us to determine what could be the
   determinants of stakeholders' preferable teaching tools, both between
   groups and countries.
   Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires covering their age,
   occupation and experience in the field of accounting, use of computer
   and internet in daily life, opinion about the need of existence of
   e-learning platform with theoretical courses and practical applications
   and finally their assessment of specific methods of teaching in
   accounting. In addition academics were asked about their methods of
   teaching (especially if they are using e-learning platforms, ERP systems
   and Internet during classes). As for the employers, additional aspect
   about need and ways of employees' trainings, was raised.},

Title = {Impact of business analytics and enterprise systems on managerial
   accounting},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {29-44},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The nature of management accountants' responsibility is evolving from
   merely reporting aggregated historical value to also including
   organizational performance measurement and providing management with
   decision related information. Corporate information systems such as
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have provided management
   accountants with both expanded data storage power and enhanced
   computational power. With big data extracted from both internal and
   external data sources, management accountants now could utilize data
   analytics techniques to answer the questions including: what has
   happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive
   analytics), and what is the optimized solution (prescriptive analytics).
   However, research shows that the nature and scope of managerial
   accounting has barely changed and that management accountants employ
   mostly descriptive analytics, some predictive analytics, and a bare
   minimum of prescriptive analytics. This paper proposes a Managerial
   Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework based on. the balanced
   scorecard theory in a business intelligence context. MADA provides
   management accountants the ability to utilize comprehensive business
   analytics to conduct performance measurement and provide decision
   related information. With MADA, three types of business analytics
   (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) are implemented into four
   corporate performance measurement perspectives (financial, customer,
   internal process, and learning and growth) in an enterprise system
   environment. Other related issues that affect the successful utilization
   of business analytics within a corporate-wide business intelligence (BI)
   system, such as data quality and data integrity, are also discussed.
   This paper contributes to the literature by discussing the impact of
   business analytics on managerial accounting from an enterprise systems
   and BI perspective and by providing the Managerial Accounting Data
   Analytics (MADA) framework that incorporates balanced scorecard
   methodology.},

Abstract = {This study examines the processes by which English linguistic capital is
   legitimized as integral to professional accountants' distinction,
   prestige, and status in Jordan. Drawing on 27 interviews, the study
   reveals the dynamic and mutual interdependency of social hierarchies and
   Jordanian accountants' agency in embedding the English language in
   everyday practices and routines. Accountants in senior positions employ
   English linguistic practices and strategies linked to the global
   structures of the profession (e.g., IFRS, enterprise resource planning
   {[}ERP] systems, Big 4 firms). Typically, these respondents already have
   a good command of English due to their elite, socially and economically
   privileged upbringing. By comparison, less powerful accountants, not
   drawn from the elite, tend to accept and internalize the need for
   English in their field, despite being more proficient in Arabic. They
   employ coping strategies that largely reinforce their marginalization,
   although occasionally they are able to open up spaces for hybrid
   linguistic practices, as they adapt the use of Arabic and English to
   their practical, daily requirements. The data also suggest that all
   Jordanian accountants in this study, regardless of social background,
   experience emotional ramifications linked to the tensions between the
   global demand for English in their field and meanings associated with
   English and Arabic due to colonial history. Through the lens of
   Bourdieu's sociolinguistic and practice theory(s), Jordanian accountants
   experience frictions and internal contradictions, ``split
   habitus/habitus clive,{''} driving them to compartmentalize (decouple)
   their Arab and professional identities in a global accountancy context.
   Insights emanating from the study have implications for understanding
   and addressing unequal power and marginalization in professional
   accounting settings in Jordan and beyond.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the market for on-demand CRM applications suffered
   especially in the segment of small and medium companies because of the
   concerns about the cost and the complexity of on request
   implementations. CRM on demand is a good choice for companies that want
   to implement standard processes that can use data structures out of
   box{''} with little or not at all internal IT support and does not
   require complex or real-time integration with back office systems.
   However, on -demand CRM software is not always as simple as vendors want
   us to believe. Customizing can be problematic and interface tools of CRM
   vendors can not provide desired levels of integration. Implementing a
   hosted CRM system should not take so much as traditional software
   packages does, but with very large and complex variants it may take even
   a year. In addition, some companies that hold sensitive data such as
   financial services could refuse to entrust control of such data to third
   parties for security reasons. For these reasons, AMR Research believes
   that by 2012, hosted CRM applications market will be only 12 percent of
   the total CRM market.
   In the last decade, CRM products were a market with strong growth, which
   has attracted a lot of companies, causing them to create their own CRM
   solutions. They created ``flagship{''} solutions of small companies,
   specialized in such services or solutions belonging to specialized
   divisions of major solutions providers such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft.
   Among these solutions we enumerate: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning),
   Supply Chain Management - SCM, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Data warehouse
   (DWH), etc. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Institutional theory in accounting information systems research:
   Shedding light on digital transformation and institutional change},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article aims to shed light on digital transformation in the
   accounting sector from the perspective of institutional change. We
   performed a systematic literature review to understand how institutional
   change could be applied to research on Accounting Information Systems
   (AIS), using a quantitative method to categorize data through LSA
   (Latent Semantic Analysis) technique; and a qualitative method performed
   by hierarchical categorical content analysis as a basis for inferences.
   We reviewed 309 articles using Institutional Theory in accounting and
   AIS. The LSA results presented the main topics of study, subfields of
   research, and uses of Institutional Theory. Regarding accounting
   research, it is possible to identify the role of institutional forces in
   the IFRS adoption (in private and public sectors), XBRL adoption, and
   disclosure of information on organizations' environmental, social, and
   governance, with a focus on analyses at the organizational level and
   regulatory pressures. A deep dive into AIS articles showed that
   Institutional Theory was applied to analyze the adoption of
   systems/technologies (mostly ERP and XBRL) through isomorphic processes
   (coercive, mimetic, and normative). We proposed to analyze digital
   technologies as an exogenous change for the digital transformation in
   accounting business using another perspective of Institutional Theory:
   institutional change. Institutional change analyzes the role of
   destabilizing elements in the change of an organizational field as a
   whole and not just in a few organizations. In this perspective,
   technology is the agent of change on a broader level, transforming

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS \& FINANCE},

Month = {2023 OCT 20},
Abstract = {This study examines the interest in different pension payout schemes
   when full annuitization is the default. We focus on three possible
   pension payout schemes: a flat-rate annuity, a high/low annuity-based
   profile, and a partial lump sum at retirement with a lower flat-rate
   annuity after that. We make use of a vignette study and find substantial
   interest in each of the three payout schemes. Interest in the lump sum
   scheme increases when a higher percentage can be taken out as a lump sum
   or when interest rates or replacement rates are lower. Interest in a
   high/low annuity-based profile increases when the high annuity is valid
   for a shorter period.},

Abstract = {Information Technology (IT) makes it possible to manage the increased
   complexity that all businesses, both public and private, face. One of
   the consequences of the growing use of IT is the large quantity of data
   produced and stored. However, very often this data is not exploited to
   their full potential. An existing tool that can increase the benefits
   related to the availability of data, specifically for supporting the
   decision-making process, is Business Intelligence (BI). BI may be
   defined as ``an integrated, company-specific, IT-based total approach
   for managerial decision support{''} (Kemper et al. Business intelligence
   and performance management: theory, systems, and industrial
   applications, Springer, U.K., pp. 3-12, 2013). We investigate the impact
   of BI on managers' behaviours. More specifically, the main aim of our
   research is to understand how the information provided by BI is used,
   what the perceived advantages and disadvantages are of its use and how
   the use of the BI module influences the managerial decision-making
   process.},

Abstract = {The area of cloud computing has the potential to become ``the next
   wave{''} of technologies having major impact on the IT-related
   professions, as it is able to determine substantial change in the field.
   Depending on the position, status, education and knowledge level of each
   individual, the impact may be positive or negative, it may become an
   opportunity to consolidate the career or, on the contrary, it may become
   the starting point of a crisis. The paper at hand intends to analyze,
   starting from a series of empirical data gathered by the author, as well
   as from a case study which the author had been given access to, what is
   the dominant position of the IT professionals regarding the cloud
   technologies massive and/or accelerated adoption process. The author's
   main interest is to find whether this reaction is mainly a positive one,
   or is it mainly rejection. The paper is part of a larger research
   process, based on the review of the relevant literature, and also on a
   synthesis of some results achieved by means of a thorough analysis of
   the opinions and study attempts performed during the last years among IT
   professionals in a set of Romanian and foreign companies.},

Abstract = {In order to make a precise production planning and scheduling, optimize
   manufacturing resources, and shorten the maximum completion time of
   batch jobs for work centers with multiple manufacturing machines, the
   production planning and scheduling for work centers with multiple
   manufacturing machines considering operating mode is researched deeply.
   A novel mathematical model called Processing Time Models is established,
   followed by a new optimization model for the number of manufacturing
   machines. A numeric example is used to test the feasibility of the
   processing time models and the optimization model for the number of
   manufacturing machines in solving the problems in this background. The
   results show that this study can accurately schedule manufacturing
   machines in each work center as well as make a precise planning of batch
   jobs under the parallel-transfer mode for work centers with multiple
   manufacturing machines.},

Abstract = {In this exploratory research, the main objective was to study the
   influence of sound and picture in advertising, by observing the neural
   responses of subjects from both genders. The EEG was recorded for 11
   female and 11 male participants, during the presentation of 2 television
   ads.
   A local frequency analysis pointed key moments of the ad. Also, a
   sLORETA analysis showed that during the first second, one of the ads
   triggered greater neural activation than the other, for both genders,
   especially in areas related with visual and auditory integration, as
   well as specific decision-related structures.
   It was concluded that sound and picture amplify each other's effects in
   advertising. Also, a local frequency and a sLORETA analysis can
   successfully point to effective moments of a marketing campaign.},

Abstract = {In complex accounting information system (AIS) environments, auditor
   planning judgements are affected by the quality of work supplied by both
   computer assurance specialists (CAS) and auditors. Prior research has
   indicated that there are concerns about CAS competence in practice, and
   the profession has acknowledged that auditors need to expand their
   expertise in the AIS domain. In this study, we investigate the effects
   of CAS competence and auditor AIS expertise on auditor planning
   judgements in a complex AIS environment. We find that both CAS
   competence and auditor AIS expertise significantly affected auditor risk
   assessments. More importantly, auditors' AIS expertise levels moderated
   their ability to effectively incorporate CAS evidence into their planned
   substantive testing. Specifically, when CAS competence was low, auditors
   with higher AIS expertise effectively expanded the scope of their audit
   testing beyond the scope set by auditors with lower AIS expertise. The
   effect of AIS expertise diminished when auditors received evidence from
   a highly competent CAS. A mediation analysis indicates the ability to
   identify potential AIS-specific risks as a mechanism behind the
   moderating effect of auditor AIS expertise. Our results suggest
   auditors' AIS expertise can play a significant role in complex AIS
   settings and in their ability to compensate for CAS competence
   deficiencies.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the influence of employees' age on problem
   perception during enterprise system (ES) implementation and use. In the
   course of exploratory research conducted among Polish companies,
   respondent opinions on ES adoption were gathered. Next, following
   grounded theory approach and incorporating open and axial coding, the
   taxonomy of problems was developed. Then, the distribution of problems
   among different age group was analyzed. The results of our investigation
   revealed that younger employees tend to report problems connected with
   detailed, technical issues. Older employees, on the other hand, seem to
   perceive to a greater extent more general problems, while experiencing
   also problems of technical nature. The current study's findings confirm
   previous results concerning general issues connected with work force
   ageing and, at the same time, shed some new light on ES implementation
   and use.},

Abstract = {This structured literature review focuses on the design and
   implementation of systems in Accounting Information System (AIS)
   research. The review has two objectives: 1) To look in depth at AIS
   research regarding the design and implementation of information systems
   related to accounting in the last fifteen years; 2) To understand design
   and implementation issues in AIS. To do so, this research examines the
   current state of design and implementation research in the domain of
   AIS, using a structured review of abstracts in top-level Information
   Systems, Accounting, and AIS journals. Using a design science in IS
   theoretical framework, the review categorizes themes and trends in AIS
   literature. Some of the most relevant themes include audit/auditors,
   enterprise resource planning, monitoring and control, adoption, and
   decision making. The most relevant issues include training, commitment,
   investment, culture, and existing business processes. The research
   includes gaps, limitations, and opportunities for future research. (C)

Title = {Improving IT assessment with IT artifact affordance perception priming},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {17-28},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurately assessing organizational information technology (IT) is
   important for accounting professionals, but also difficult. Both
   auditors and the professionals from whom they gather data are expected
   to make nuanced judgments regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of
   controls that protect key systems. IT artifacts (policies, procedures,
   and systems) are assessed in an audit because they ``afford{''} relevant
   action possibilities but perception preferences shade the results of
   even systematic and well-tested assessment tools. This study of 246
   business students makes two important contributions. First we
   demonstrate that a tendency to focus on either artifact or
   organizational imperative systematically reduces the power of
   well-regarded IT measurements. Second, we demonstrate that priming is an
   effective intervention strategy to increase the predictive power of
   constructs from the familiar technology acceptance model (TAM). (C) 2015

Abstract = {Retrieving information from an intensive hand-collected whitepaper data
   library covering 5,033 ICOs launched before 2020, we analyze the
   determinants of ICO success as measured by the amount of raised funding.
   We assess the sentiment and readability in ICO whitepapers in addition
   to other information disclosures. Whereas we do not find any evidence
   for that the riskiness of ICO projects would lower the predicted amount
   of raised funding, our results strongly suggest that ICO investors are
   largely guided by emotions when making investment decisions. Contrary to
   earlier literature, we find a weak association between quality signals
   of whitepapers and its success.},

Title = {Examining the role of the AIS research literature using the natural
   experiment of the 2018 JIS conference on cloud computing},

Abstract = {This paper examines the nature and purpose of the AIS research
   literature, doing so in a focused setting that enables a more nuanced
   analysis than is possible when reviewing the field as a whole.
   Specifically, I examine the population of the AIS literature on cloud
   computing, a technology chosen because it was the subject of the
   recently held 2018 Journal of Information Systems annual conference. I
   treat the conference as a natural experiment because the choice of
   papers for that conference is the best indication of the current state
   of thinking about not just cloud computing in AIS, but of the kind of
   research considered desirable in the field. The published and conference
   papers are analyzed using the frameworks of Alles, Kogan and Vasarhelyi
   (2008) and O'Leary (2008) who provide a guide for how AIS researchers
   can write papers that give them a comparative advantage relative to
   other, competing researchers, and to do the right research at the right
   time in the right way. Based on this analysis, I conclude that the AIS
   cloud computing literature largely fails to establish a clear role for
   itself relative to either the field of accounting or of cloud computing.
   That is largely the result of the AIS community being unwilling to
   distinguish between cloud computing as an end in itself as a research
   subject and the cloud as a means towards an end as a medium of data
   exchange. Adopting a broad perspective on the domain of AIS research
   yields a larger set of research topics but increases the riskiness of
   producing research that fails to add value to the broader literature.
   This is a lesson that extends beyond cloud computing to the AIS research
   literature as a whole.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to analyze the impact of information technology
   (IT) system implementation on the integration of data and information
   between sales and accounting departments, and how data integration
   affects relations with supplier and customers.
   Design/methodology/approach The change between three different
   reservation and distribution systems in an airline company was assessed
   over 20 years based on qualitative data collected while events unfolded
   and interviews that traced events retrospectively. Findings This study
   finds that data integration challenges affect the capacity to use
   revenue and sales data for control purposes and integrating with
   suppliers and customers. The systems either facilitated the ability to
   integrate sales and accounting data or enabled integration in wider
   supplier and customer networks. The implementation of different
   reservation and distribution systems resulted in a trade-off between
   integration within the firm and into wider customer and supplier
   networks. Research limitations/implications Data were mainly obtained
   from the focal firm, Air Greenland. The protracted study period meant
   that the data were not as concentrated as they would have been had the
   analysis been performed over a shorter duration or had the focus been on
   one implementation process. Originality/value Extant research suggests
   that integration challenges when implementing IT systems are caused by
   differences in information needs between groups with different logics.
   The authors illustrate how data integration is also a crucial challenge
   when implementing IT systems.},

Abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the Journal
   of Emerging Technologies in Accounting (JETA) from 2008 to 2022, the
   period since its indexing in Web of Science, focusing on authorship
   patterns, dominant topics, and citation trends. The findings highlight a
   significant concentration of authorship within JETA, suggesting an
   opportunity for enhancing diversity and introducing fresh perspectives
   through expanded authorial engagement. Acknowledging JETA's significant
   contributions to blockchain, text analysis/NLP, and AI, this study
   proposes an exploration into broader, interdisciplinary domains to
   further enrich the journal's thematic diversity, in alignment with
   global academic trends. The study further recognizes an opportunity for
   JETA to bolster its global impact by inviting contributions from
   underrepresented regions, such as South America, Australia, and Africa.
   Additionally, the analysis reveals a commendable trend in JETA toward
   collaborative and potentially interdisciplinary research, implying that
   fostering such collaborations could yield innovative research
   methodologies in the field.},

Abstract = {We investigate how owners of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
   perceive, make sense of, and practice risk management. Drawing on
   Schatzki's practice theory, we theorize on how and why risk management
   happens in SMEs. Thus, we fill a gap in the extant literature, which
   focuses almost exclusively on risk management within large
   organizations. We interview entrepreneurs and conduct site observations
   to gain insight into their risk management activities, the drivers that
   lead to the adoption of said activities, their attitudes toward risk
   management, and how their accountants may shape and contribute to risk
   management in SMEs. We find that rather than a specific set of formal
   processes, entrepreneurs view risk management as a mindset that
   emphasizes the preservation of key assets, creation of competitive
   advantages, and development of local talent and expertise. We observe
   practices that are mainly informal yet planned, deliberate, and fully
   integrated within the fabric of organizations that align with ideal
   forms of risk management. We also find that full-time, in-house
   accountants do help entrepreneurs with risk management, while external
   accountants, whose main activities relate to financial statement
   preparation and tax filings, do not systematically help entrepreneurs
   manage risk. We contribute to both the theory and practice of risk
   management by sharing empirical insights into how SME owners perceive,
   make sense of, and manage risk.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the financial and operational implications of
   enterprise systems (ESs) in corporate risk management. Using matched
   difference-in-differences analyses based on ES implementation events, we
   document a significant reduction in the volatility of operating cash
   flows following ES implementations. We further show that ES implementers
   have better post-implementation operational efficiency than matched
   non-ES firms and better manage sales, costs of sales, working capital,
   and operating expenses to reduce operating cash flow volatility.
   Consistent with the benefits of lower cash flow volatility documented in
   prior literature, we find ES implementers demonstrate higher investment
   efficiency, lower reliance on external financing, and higher debt
   capacity post-ES-implementation than the matched non-ES firms. Our study
   sheds light on the economic benefits of utilizing ESs in corporate risk
   management and in so doing responds to the paucity of empirical research
   in this area.},

Abstract = {Bookkeeping is crucial in both accounting and auditing. However, a
   substantial quantity of accounting information initially recorded using
   unstructured natural language, which restricts the efficiency and
   accuracy of bookkeeping. In this study, we exploit proprietary
   transaction data from three firms to demonstrate the capacity of a word
   embedding approach based on a neural network model (i.e., Word2vec) for
   processing transaction-related natural language and automating
   bookkeeping practice. Our study contributes to accounting practice and
   literature by demonstrating a practical application of Word2vec to the
   construction of an automated bookkeeping system.},

Abstract = {PurposeSeveral conceptual works suggest that more digitalized
   information systems in management accounting have the potential to make
   this corporate function more effective. Against this backdrop, this
   study aims to investigate the impact of information systems quality in
   management accounting on the effectiveness of management control
   systems. Additionally, this study examines the moderating effect of
   process automation. Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional survey
   of 125 German Mittelstand firms and hierarchical regression analyses
   were used for data collection and analysis. FindingsThe findings confirm
   the assumed positive effect of information systems quality in management
   accounting on management control effectiveness. They also confirm the
   assumed moderating effect of process automation. The authors find that
   the relationship between information systems quality in management
   accounting and management control effectiveness is more pronounced if
   the firm features a higher degree of process automation.
   Originality/valueSeveral earlier case studies and a few quantitative
   studies indicated the potentially positive effect of high-quality
   information systems in management accounting on management control
   effectiveness. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is
   among the first to deliver quantitative proof of this relationship in
   the context of German Mittelstand firms. Moreover, the authors add to
   this literature the moderating effect of process automation in the
   relationship between information systems quality in management
   accounting and management control effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The study investigates the implications of companies' adoption of
   blockchain technology on accounting information quality. Based on a
   sample of 33,242 firm-year observations from A-share companies listed on
   China's stock exchanges in 2007-2019, we find evidence that blockchain
   technology adoption significantly improves accounting information
   quality. Further, additional tests demonstrate that the mechanism of
   blockchain exerting its positive effect include strengthening corporate
   governance and realising synergies with large audit firms, while
   cross-sectional tests show that its positive effect on accounting
   information quality is attenuated if the company is in an industry with
   high IT development or has experienced an audit firm change. Economic
   consequence tests show that the adoption of blockchain is conducive to
   companies' financing behaviour, as well as to overall firm value.
   Consequently, our results suggest the positive effect of blockchain
   technology on accounting information quality.},

Title = {The role of internet-related technologies in shaping the work of

Abstract = {This paper reviews the accounting literature that focuses on four
   Internet-related technologies that have the potential to dramatically
   change and disrupt the work of accountants and accounting researchers in
   the near future. These include cloud, big data, blockchain, and
   artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, access to distributed
   ledgers (blockchain) and big data supported by cloud-based analytics
   tools and AI will automate decision making to a large extent. These
   technologies may significantly improve financial visibility and allow
   more timely intervention due to the perpetual nature of accounting.
   However, given the number of tasks technology has relieved of
   accountants, these technologies may also lead to concerns about the
   profession's legitimacy. The findings suggest that scholars have not
   given sufficient attention to these technologies and how these
   technologies affect the everyday work of accountants. Research is
   urgently needed to understand the new kinds of accounting required to
   manage firms in the changing digital economy and to determine the new
   skills and competencies accountants may need to master to remain
   relevant and add value. The paper outlines a set of questions to guide
   future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this work, I studied whether news media sentiments have an impact on
   Bitcoin volatility. In doing so, I applied three different range-based
   volatility estimates along with two different sentiments, namely
   psychological sentiments and financial sentiments, incorporating four
   various sentiment dictionaries. By analyzing 17,490 news coverages by 91
   major English-language newspapers listed in the LexisNexis database from
   around the globe from January 2012 until August 2021, I found news media
   sentiments to play a significant role in Bitcoin volatility. Following
   the heterogeneous autoregressive model for realized volatility
   (HAR-RV)-which uses the heterogeneous market idea to create a simple
   additive volatility model at different scales to learn which factor is
   influencing the time series-along with news sentiments as explanatory
   variables, showed a better fit and higher forecasting accuracy.
   Furthermore, I also found that psychological sentiments have medium-term
   and financial sentiments have long-term effects on Bitcoin volatility.
   Moreover, the National Research Council Emotion Lexicon showed the main
   emotional drivers of Bitcoin volatility to be anticipation and trust.},

Abstract = {We consider how the information environment effects of enterprise system
   (ES) forecasting tools affect a given manager's decision to manipulate
   reported performance. As ES forecasting accuracy increases, the manager
   is better able to determine whether anticipated performance is going to
   exceed the desired level of performance, and we propose that this may
   affect how the manager chooses to use the ES. To investigate this
   setting, we construct a model of manipulation behavior as a function of
   desired performance, uncertainty in forecasted performance and internal
   control strength. The implications of the model suggest that as a
   manager's forecast of an impending shortfall in expected performance
   becomes more certain, the economically optimal decision is increasingly
   to manipulate reported performance and to use smaller magnitude
   adjustments. This result holds unless a significant countervailing
   investment in internal control strength accompanies the ES, which
   evidence suggests is not the norm in practice. This study furthers our
   understanding of the effects of ES adoption on managerial behavior and
   contributes to the burgeoning literature investigating the dual control
   and empowerment roles of technology. Opportunities for future research
   are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Executives see technology, data and analytics as a transforming force in
   business. Many organizations are therefore implementing business
   intelligence \& analytics (BI\&A) technologies to support reporting and
   decision-making. Traditionally, management accounting is the primary
   support for decision-making and control in an organization. As such, it
   has clear links to and can benefit from applying BI\&A technologies.
   This indicates an interesting research area for accounting and AIS
   researchers. However, a review of the literature in top accounting and
   information systems journals indicates that to date, little research has
   focused on this link. This article reviews the literature, points to
   several research gaps and proposes a framework for studying the
   relationship between BI\&A and management accounting.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, information systems (ISs) have made dynamic
   developments in light of their ability to enhance the performances of
   businesses. In relation to this, an organization that is effectively and
   efficiently managed often displays optimum performance using financial
   systems such as electronic accounting (e-accounting). Thus, essentially,
   e-accounting is utilized for the automation of operational processes and
   for improving business efficiency and performance. More currently,
   e-accounting dynamic development has laid credence to the performance of
   businesses in a way that the influence cannot be exaggerated.
   Nevertheless, past studies evidenced that successful e-accounting
   depends on critical success factors, and hence this study primarily aims
   to conduct an evaluation of e-accounting using DeLone and McLean's
   information system model (DM ISM) among firms in Jordan. More
   specifically, this study determines the influence of information
   quality, system quality, service quality, system usage, and user
   satisfaction on business performance. The current study adopted a
   quantitative method, applying a self-administered survey questionnaire
   for the purpose of data collection from 104 e-accounting users. This
   study employed partial least squares structural equation modeling
   (PLS-SEM) to validate the data, and based on the findings, system
   quality and information quality affect system use; service quality of
   e-accounting had no significant impact on use, but e-accounting use had
   a significant influence on the satisfaction of users. Moreover,
   e-accounting system use and user satisfaction positively influence
   business performance. This study is an extension of the current IS
   literature, particularly of those focused on determining the effects of
   e-accounting benefits. This study validated the proposed model in the
   context of Jordanian firms and contributes to both the literature on and
   practice of e-accounting. This study provided implications, limitations,
   and recommendations for future research.},

Abstract = {This study uses an archival research design to assess the impact of
   enterprise systems on a firm's internal information environment as
   reflected in the production of management earnings forecasts.
   Specifically, the authors hypothesize that, if enterprise systems
   improve management's access to decision-relevant internal information,
   higher quality management earnings forecasts should ensue. Consistent
   with disclosure theory and the purported technical characteristics of
   enterprise systems, the authors find a positive association between
   enterprise system implementations and subsequent increases in the
   likelihood of management forecast issuance and the accuracy of the
   forecasts. Additional robustness tests support the argument that
   improvements in management forecasts are due to improvements in the
   firm's internal information environment rather than to enhancements in
   management's ability to manage earnings. Beyond accumulating financial
   reporting information, the authors note that such systems provide
   management with information to make day-to-day operational decisions.
   Moreover, the paper provides a basis for considering management forecast
   qualities as a measurable proxy for improvements in the firm's internal
   information environment that result from information technology
   investments.},
