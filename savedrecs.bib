Abstract = {In recent years, along with the smart city concept, the smart city
   construction has been concerned at home and abroad. In order to measure
   the development level of the smart city, this paper constructs the smart
   city galaxy structure model and its evaluation system based on the
   connotation of the smart city and the influence factors of the smart
   urban development. The weight of each dimension is calculated by entropy
   method, then the evaluation system of galaxy structure model tries to be
   applicated with the instance. The main value of the model of the smart
   city galaxy structure and its evaluation system is to realize the
   operability of the concept of smart city, and to provide a useful
   reference for further promoting smart city development level.},

Abstract = {Smart city concept has gained importance in urban development literature
   and there have been many initiatives and projects around the world
   implementing the smart city concepts. There is a need for an assessment
   framework, customized for the local context. This study aims to offer a
   holistic assessment framework for smart city projects, which include
   smart city dimensions and application areas. The framework is then used
   for Istanbul's recent smart city project. The improvement areas are
   specified, and recommendations are made to increase the effectiveness of
   Istanbul's project by using this framework. The results show that
   technology as a dimension and smart mobility as an application area have
   the highest scores. Governance and institutional context dimensions as
   well as smart building and energy areas are recommended to be addressed
   more in the project. The framework can be used for other smart city
   projects around the world as well.},

Abstract = {Purpose Understanding policy consequences for cities is very important
   in an urban setting, especially in this era of developing solutions for
   grand challenges. Climate change adaptation and smart cities are
   emerging topics in the climate change and sustainability domain.
   Therefore, this paper aims to achieve a better understanding of policy
   consequences and exploring synergies of climate change adaptation and
   smart cities are valuable for both research and practice.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper systematically reviews synergies
   of smart city applications in urban climate change adaptation
   literature. A systematic literature review and content analysis are
   carried out to answer the research questions and a theoretically based
   smart cities concept matrix with synergetic coproduction theory is used
   to assess the empirical studies. Findings Key findings are that the
   model of synergetic coproduction could identify the benefits co-existing
   in smart city and climate change adaptation. While smart people and
   smart government play the fundamental roles, synergies could co-occur in
   other smart city dimensions. Smart city applications in climate change
   adaptation could increase competitiveness in cities by exploiting the
   opportunities as well as reducing the harmful risks.
   Originality/value This study combines two emerging topics in the
   assessment, climate change adaptation and smart cities, and represents a
   new way of assessing literature and possibly policy outcomes for the
   cities. By using the theoretical framework from smart cities and theory
   of coproduction, a theory-based framework is developed for assessing the
   empirical studies of climate adaptation in cities. The findings from the
   systematic literature review indicate relations among smart city
   dimensions in a clear manner and also identify the synergies of smart
   cities and climate adaptation.},

Abstract = {Contemporary urban areas are usually multi-million cities,
   agglomerations and metropolises, whose development was determined by
   historical, spatial, economic, social and political factors. The
   concentration of economic and social activities in these areas causes
   many negative effects influencing the conditions and quality of life of
   residents. Existing problems, development opportunities and expectations
   of the residents are different in different cities. Constant urban
   population growth requires preparation of proper development plans and
   responsible management of these areas. There are also new cities which
   are built from scratch (so-called greenfield development), that are
   expected to guarantee residents a high quality of life. Intelligent
   urban development is based on the concept of a smart city as a modern
   city of the future, assuming sustainable urban development based on
   innovative technologies. The aim of intelligent technologies used in the
   cities is to improve their functionality and to support the residents
   and provide them with comfortable, economic and safe lives. The smart
   city concept is the subject of broad deliberations in the literature and
   there are many different definitions that emphasize technical, social,
   institutional and environmental aspects. Six essential components that
   make up a smart city are often listed: smart governance, smart economy,
   smart mobility, smart environment, smart people, smart living. Different
   phases of intelligent cities development are also described. The aim of
   the article is to present global demographic, technological and
   innovative trends in the development of urban areas in the aspect of
   smart cities of the future.},

   in cities with an emphasis on digital technologies. This mainly concerns
   the participation in decision-making as a part of the smart government.
   The participation means opportunity for citizens to participate in the
   management of the city. This academic paper presents basic concepts of a
   smart city as well as specific ways how smart cities can increase the
   participation of their citizenry, especially with regard to social
   media. Based on a literature search it is obvious that the involvement
   of citizens strengthens democracy and the quality of the decision-making
   process.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Bring to light the risks of smart cities and the perspectives
   of their management. It has been discovered that smart cities are
   created and developed under the impact of not only technological factors
   but also social factors. The connection between smart cities and quality
   of life is systemic (direct and reverse)-the quality of life also
   specifies the creation and development of smart cities. The impact of
   the COVID-19 pandemic on the development of smart cities is almost null
   (smart cities do not depend on the implementation of SDG 3). This
   paper's originality lies in the description of a new angle of studying
   smart cities-from the position of risks, and in the determination of the
   current level of these risks and the dynamics of their change during
   systematisation and description of the wide international experience of
   creation and development of smart cities. This paper's uniqueness lies
   in the development of a new approach to managing the creation and
   development of smart cities, which is based on corporate social
   responsibility, thus specifying and ensuring the involvement and
   important role of the subjects of entrepreneurship in this process. It
   is proved that the contribution of smart cities to the implementation of
   the SDGs is much wider and goes beyond the limits of SDG 9-it also
   extends to SDG 1 and SDGs 11-13.},

Abstract = {With rapid development of construction industry, the amount and
   complexity of Smart City of construction information are growing,
   because the construction scale is much larger and the process is more
   complicated than before. Although construction industry in China has an
   increasing investment on informationization and application of emerging
   information technologies research in recent years, there are many
   problems on Smart City and emerging information technologies. Theory of
   New-type Smart City in China is proposed by China Electronics Technology
   Group Corporation (CETC). Moreover, application and integration of
   emerging IT within new-type Smart City are analyzes, such as internet of
   things, BIM, ubiquitous computing, and 4D visualization. The research
   indicates the direction of subsequent theory research and practice
   research on new-type Smart City in China.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study examines the reporting practices of a sample of
   awarded smart cities that report in English by analyzing the financial
   and non-financial reports published in their websites.
   Design/methodology/approach The study performs a manifest content
   analysis on the financial and non-financial reports published by a
   sample of awarded - by various networks and organizations - smart
   cities. Integrated Popular Reporting that builds on Integrated
   Reporting, Popular Reporting and ICT advancements is used as the
   reference paradigm to analyze the content and the characteristics of
   these reports. Findings The results indicate that smart cities' reports
   are mainly developed conventionally and do not embed technological
   advancements. However, there are several smart cities that adopt a
   reporting paradigm where the five capitals of Integrated Reporting, over
   and above the financial one, are discussed. Originality/value
   Systematizing the way the existing reports of smart cities are developed
   provides evidence whether smart cities adopt reporting means that are
   consistent with their character, as well as, the specific areas they
   should focus to achieve that. Toward this end, collaborations between
   citizens and smart city councils, in the philosophy of co-production and
   co-creation of public value, could prove helpful in the development of
   useful reports.},

Title = {Smart city dynamics and multi-level management accounting: unfolding a
   case of sustainable enterprise resource planning},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-54},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to explore the complex, multi-level institutional
   dynamics of smart city reforms and projects and their potential
   sustainability pressures on the implementation of a management
   accounting system in an Egyptian state-owned enterprise (SOE), which has
   a politically sensitive institutional character.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study adds to institutional management accounting research using a
   multi-level perspective of institutional dynamics in the smart city
   context. Data were collected from an interpretive case study of an
   Egyptian SOE that was under socio-political sustainability pressures to
   implement a smart electricity network project in New Minya city.
   Findings
   Smart city projects have formed social and political sustainability
   pressures, which introduced the enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   network as a new management accounting system. A new (complex and
   multi-level) management accounting system was invented to reinvent the
   sustainable city as an ``accounting city{''} (which appeared
   rhetorically as a ``smart city{''}). ``Smart{''} being the visibility
   and measurability of the sustainability performance of the collective
   body, which calls the city and its connectivity to different
   institutional levels brought out in a city network project for the
   ERP-enabled electricity distribution.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study examines a single case study from a single smart city and
   identifies the accounting community's need for multiple and comparative
   case studies to further analyse the potential impact of smart city
   reforms and projects on the sustainable implementation of management
   accounting systems.
   Practical implications
   City policymakers and managers may benefit from the practical findings
   of this interpretive field-based case study in planning, implementing
   and monitoring smart city projects and objectives.
   Social implications
   Individual and collective well-being may be enhanced through new
   management accounting forms of multi-level local governance and
   increased political, field and organisational sustainability.
   Originality/value
   This study provides important insights into the sustainability dynamics
   of management accounting in achieving smart city reforms. The
   achievement of sustainability management accounting systems has
   connected to multiple ERP roles at different institutional levels, which
   resulted in accommodating the socio-political objectives of smart city
   projects.},

Title = {Government ESG reporting in smart cities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {54},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Governments shoulder the responsibility of pursuing a variety of
   sustainability objectives, the consequences of which may not be
   discernable in traditional reporting frameworks. Environmental, Social,
   and Governance (ESG) reporting would be a valuable addition to the
   existing financial, service, and infrastructure aspects of government
   reporting. While reportable data may be difficult to measure, smart city
   development strategies dovetail with technologies that facilitate
   sustainability reporting. Smart city strategies utilize technologies to
   support and inform municipal governance. This paper proposes a framework
   of government ESG reporting based on smart city initiatives, details
   potential steps in the process of government ESG reporting, discusses
   how smart cities could facilitate ESG reporting, and illustrates
   potential avenues of analysis using New York City vehicular mobility
   data as an example. This research sheds light on an underexamined topic,
   offers a perspective on adding ESG to government reporting, explores how
   sustainability data can inform government ESG reporting, and
   demonstrates the utility of smart city data for reporting, assurance,
   and monitoring.},

Abstract = {Currently there are more than 7 billion people living on Earth and at
   least 1 million inhabitants globally live in cities. Modern cities start
   to use smart infrastructure and digitalization for sustainable
   development. The article is devoted to considering the smart
   technologies in city participative budgeting.
   City budget and financial and economic policy are under trends of
   digitalization and citizen's participation. Such attitudes and their
   formation depend on many factors, both public subjective and urban
   objective. At the same time modern smart cities involve the
   technological solutions introduction that significantly changes the
   urban life, which forms new behavioural patterns of interaction between
   citizens and the urban environment. Participation, individual
   capacities, and coordination are key factors for improving the
   efficiency of the financial and economic system and efficiency of urban
   management.
   Through these important aspects, it opens strategy perspectives in the
   fields of participative urban management and the implementation of
   digital governance. The paper investigates influence of digitalization
   in city budgeting and attracting citizens to city management.},

Abstract = {This scientific approach mainly aims to develop a smart city/smart
   community concept to objectively evaluate the progress of these
   organizational forms in relation to other classical/traditional forms of
   city organizations. The elaborated model allowed the construction of the
   dashboard of access actions in the smart city/smart community category
   on two levels of financial effort correlated with the effect on the
   sustainable development of smart cities. The validity of the proposed
   model and our approach was supported by the complex statistical analysis
   performed in this study. The research concluded that low-cost solutions
   are the most effective in supporting smart urban development. They
   should be followed by the other category of solutions, which implies
   more significant financial and managerial efforts as well as a higher
   rate of welfare growth for urban citizens. The main outcomes of this
   research include modelling solutions related to smart city development
   at a low-cost level and identifying the sensitivity elements that
   maximize the growth function. The implications of this research are to
   provide viable alternatives based on smart city development
   opportunities with medium and long-term effects on urban communities,
   economic sustainability, and translation into urban development rates.
   This study's results are useful for all administrations ready for change
   that want the rapid implementation of the measures with beneficial
   effects on the community or which, through a strategic vision, aim to
   connect to the European objectives of sustainable growth and social
   welfare for citizens. Practically, this study is a tool for defining and
   implementing smart public policies at the urban level.},

Abstract = {Cities play a major role in the social and economic aspects of our lives
   and have a huge impact on the environment. Over the last 35 years there
   has been a worldwide increase in population by about 60 \% and more and
   research shows that this trend will continue. More and more people are
   therefore moving to urban settlements mainly due to offer the jobs.
   SMART city is trying to find a concept that ensures sustainable model of
   development, quality of life, public safety and energy efficiency. This
   article focuses mainly on comparison of the smart cities in the Czech
   Republic and foreign countries deploying clever parking, traffic
   optimization, and systems that are beneficial for maintaining the
   transport infrastructure to the satisfaction of all residents. Using
   comparative analysis is processed compared the concept of SMART cities
   in the Czech Republic and abroad in order to obtain an objective
   comparison creation, approval and implementation of the strategy on a
   sample of selected countries to create a design concept of SMART city in
   the Czech Republic. Compare analysis shows that the feature of SMART
   cities in the Czech Republic is strongly connected with the government.
   It was proved that the mobility ranking is really important for the
   concept of SMART cities in future. In comparison with the other European
   countries, is the Czech Republic in the implementation of SMART cities
   rookie.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of performance
   measurement systems as technologies of government in the
   operationalisation of smart city programmes. It answers the research
   question: how do the development and use of performance measurement
   systems support smart cities in the achievement of their goals?
   Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a longitudinal case
   study that uses an interventionist approach to investigate the
   possibilities and limitations of the use of performance measurement
   systems as technologies of government in a smart city. Interpretations
   are theoretically informed by the Foucauldian governmentality framework
   (Foucault, 2009) and by public sector performance measurement
   literature. Findings The findings address the benefits and criticalities
   confronting a smart city that introduces new performance measurement
   systems as a technology of government. Such technologies become
   problematic tools when the city network is characterised by a
   fragmentation of inter-departmental processes, and when forms of
   resistance emerge due to a lack of process owners, horizontal
   accountability and cooperation among involved parties. Originality/value
   This paper offers a critical understanding of the role of accounting in
   the smart city. The ineffectiveness of performance measurement systems
   is related to the multiple roles of such technologies of government,
   which may lead to a temporary paralysis in the achievement of smart city
   goals and programmes.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study addresses the implications of smart city development
   paths (techno-centric and human-centric) by investigating the evolution
   of a city strategy, focusing on how different actors in a dialogue
   centred on strategic planning documents for Saint Petersburg, Russia,
   visualised the smart city and then made it calculable.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a case study based on
   a documentary analysis supported by ethnographic elements relying on the
   smart city conceptual proposals, the approved city strategy and the
   artifacts of expert discussions leading to the strategy implementation
   plan. Findings Through the lens of dialogue theory, the authors show how
   government and non-government actors in different organisational
   settings devised techno-centric smart city calculations, which arose
   despite an initial human-centric vision. Research
   limitations/implications While the case study allowed the study to
   illustrate the depth and richness of the context of the authoritarian
   Russian state where the role of citizens in public decision-making is
   rather limited, different and even contrasting results could be produced
   in other contexts. Practical implications There is a gap between a smart
   city vision and its grounding in calculations. Thus, the human-centric
   elements require special attention, and the organisation of the dialogue
   on smart city strategy must enable plurality of voices besides those of
   government actors. Originality/value The case suggests viewing the
   human-centric and techno-centric perspectives not as dichotomous, but
   rather emerging consecutively throughout the journey from an initial
   strategic vision to its implementation in the city's calculations.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to fill a gap in the real estate
   academic literature by defining the essence of real estate in smart
   urban environments. Space has traditionally been a silent component of
   real estate. Smart technologies powered by Ubi-comp are turning space
   into an active part of real estate, which represents a paradigm shift
   for commercial real estate. This shift requires new concepts and tools
   to analyse and model real estate in smart cities.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper defines the notions of smart space
   and smart real estate. Several concepts and tools are formulated,
   starting with a model of space users in smart cities, called the
   Cyber-Dasein inspired by Heidegger's existential phenomenology of space.
   Findings The paper then analyses smart space's attributes and proposes
   several metrics for commercial real estate in smart environments. After
   introducing three regression models for constructing a price index of
   smart real estate, the paper concludes by advocating that commercial
   real estate take an active role in the current debate about smart
   cities.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing concern at the global level to promote
   development in a comprehensive and equitable manner by taking into
   account several key factors such as climate change, extreme poverty and
   hunger, child mortality, environmental sustainability and universal
   primary education. This is why many stakeholders have made significant
   efforts to design and implement smart and sustainable development
   strategies in order to find smart solutions for global, regional and
   national problems. During the history, urbanization has represented a
   positive force that fostered the prosperity of human beings and
   contributed to the economic development. The paper aims to present the
   theoretical foundation of the concepts of smart city and sustainable
   development and to show their connection in the 21st century. To such
   end, the authors used a quantitative research method that explains these
   two concepts and seeks to validate their relationship. The concept of
   smart city has proved to represent both a useful tool and a successful
   way of thinking to address the unprecedented sustainability challenges
   of the 21st century. The paper shows that the connection between smart
   city and sustainable development has led to the emergence of a new
   concept: the smart and sustainable city.},

Abstract = {The Indian government is currently developing scalable and sustainable
   smart city infrastructures to address the urbanization problem in India.
   However, the smart city project will only be successful if the people
   accept and use smart services. Therefore, this study investigates
   peoples' acceptance of smart services using a modified unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology model (UTAUT). The results demonstrate
   that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and attitude are
   significant factors in peoples' usage intention toward smart services.
   Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of task-technology
   fit and perceived risk on the relationship between performance
   expectancy, effort expectancy, and attitude and usage intention. The
   study's findings will help decision-makers and professional accountants

Abstract = {Urban areas are confronted with the problem of high concentration of
   people with implications for the sustainability, quality of life, and
   competitiveness of the region. A United Nations (UN) study points out
   that, for the first time in history, more than half of the population on
   the planet (54.6 percent or 3.6 billion people) lives in cities. As a
   consequence of globalization, cities have to solve more problems, public
   funds need to be better targeted and natural resources need to be
   explored consciously and responsibly. Digital revolution brought
   possibility to use technology as a driver to solve old problems by new
   ways. Moreover, it also brought new options how to enhance sustainable
   development. Smart City initiatives can be viewed as an innovation as it
   align new technologies with new processes, new participatory policy, and
   new management methods. In sum, Smart City represents changes in
   governance and daily life. In our article we conceptualize Smart City as
   socio-technical system with focus on the social part. We use traditional
   socio-technical model, proposed by Leavitt in 1965. We also consider
   approaches to evaluation of the success of Smart Cities initiatives with
   possible metrics. As the result we propose evaluation framework for the
   evaluation of success of Smart City initiatives.},

Abstract = {Today, cities are the main forces of economic development, and have
   occupied a central place in production, consumption, defining social and
   economic relations and, currently provide a significant share of gross
   domestic product at the regional level. Cities play a critical role in
   national, regional and global development. Of course, the quality of
   living of people in the region depends on them. So today, cities must
   meet special requirements, such as the availability of urban
   infrastructure, mobility, security, urban areas, environmental
   friendliness, development of city self-management, quality and
   comfortable accommodation. Implementation in totality of the above
   factors, allows us to classify this type of city to a new kind called a
   ``smart city{''}, one of the basic philosophy principles of which is
   safe and comfortable accommodation. The purpose of the paper is
   theoretical and methodological substantiations of the concept of ``smart
   living{''} as the most important aspects of the formation of ``smart
   cities{''} from the standpoint of population provision with affordable
   and comfortable housing. Subject of paper - factors, that determine the
   comfort and affordability of residential real estate smart cities, and
   the object of research - the sphere of housing construction of the city,
   providing safe and comfortable accommodation. The results of testing the
   author's approach proves the possibility of the implementation of
   measures to achieve the General goal of providing the population with
   quality and affordable housing to meet the quality standards of granting
   housing and communal services as one of the basic principles of the
   smart city philosophy.},

Abstract = {Purpose The paper explores the emergence of smart city governance with a
   particular focus on the cognitive value of the new technologies and the
   different accountabilities emerging in the digital infrastructures
   attempting to visualize and rationalize urban dynamics.
   Design/methodology/approach Drawing on ethnographic, netnographic and
   interview data from an empirical case study of the Smart and Wise City
   Turku spearhead project, the study builds on the assumption that smart
   cities emerge from the interaction between the characteristics of
   technologies, constellations of actors and contextual conditions.
   Findings The results report smart city activities as an organizational
   process and a reconfiguration that incorporates new technology with old
   infrastructure. Through the lens of the empirical examples, we are able
   to show how smart city actors, boundaries and infrastructures are
   mobilized, become valuable and are rendered visible. The smart cities
   infrastructure traces, values and governs actors, identities, objects,
   ideas and relations to animate new desires and feats of imagination.
   Practical implications In terms of implications to practice, the
   situated descriptions echo recent calls to leaders and managers to ask
   how much traceability is enough (Power, 2019) and limits of
   accountability (Messner, 2009). Originality/value The central
   theoretical concept of ``thinking infrastructure{''} highlights how new
   accounting practices operate by disclosing (Kornberger et al., 2017) new
   worlds where the platforms and the users discover the nature of their
   responsibilities to the other. The contribution of this paper is that it
   examines what happens when smartness is understood as a thinking
   infrastructure. Different theorizations of infrastructure have
   implications for the study of smart cities. The lens helps us grasp
   possible tensions and consequences in terms of accountability that arise
   from new forms of participation in smart cities. It helps urban
   governance scholarship understand how smartness informs and shapes
   distributed and embodied cognition.},

Abstract = {Circular economy is a concept that is recognized as having a great
   potential in such global issue mitigation as climate change, loss of
   biodiversity, resource scarcity, deforestation, air water and soil
   pollution, etc. With the rapid development of information and
   communication technologies the concept of smart city has also gained the
   attention in scientific, political and business environment as well as
   in whole society. The objective of the article is to evaluate the
   similarities and differences between circular economy and smart city
   concepts. For this purpose authors used the methodology of literature
   review and qualitative content analysis. Results show that there are
   similarities between concepts of circular economy and smart city related
   to management of resources, resource efficiency, consumption, industrial
   symbiosis, renewable energy, sustainable development goals, sharing
   economy, business models and innovation. However, there are also
   differences between concepts as circular economy emphasises value
   preservation, systems thinking and life cycle thinking while concept of
   smart city emphasises technology, increased life quality, creativity,
   urban areas and security.},

Title = {SMART CITY IN ENSURING HUMAN SOCIAL SECURITY IN WAR CONDITIONS},
Journal = {ACADEMY REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-248},
Abstract = {The features of developing a smart city in war conditions are studied.
   In conditions of danger, the developed infrastructure of the city can
   help its residents, which is what the ``smart city{''} is focused on in
   its human-centric approach. The international experience of ensuring the
   safety and resource-saving of a smart city in emergencies has been
   studied: initiatives to combine technologies and people; creation of
   ``green{''} and ``smart{''} construction laboratories; energy resource
   management system; methods for incorporating technical and social
   development into improving the quality of life; robotic systems that
   help to properly use resources in the event of a threat.
   The role of a smart city in ensuring a person's social security in the
   context of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine and the features of
   cooperation between the private and public sectors when launching smart
   city initiatives is analyzed. The place of small and medium-sized
   businesses in the provision of services in the first months of the war
   was found: providing the population with food and medicine, free travel
   on some routes, free Internet services in shelters, which helped people
   receive timely notifications and stay in touch with their relatives.
   We concluded that projects that increase the safety of citizens and
   provide equipment for shelters or their modernization, as well as
   energy-saving measures, are extremely important in a war. Therefore,
   ways to balance between human social security and smart city resource
   saving in times of war include the following: the use of public-private
   partnership (when private capital is attracted, part of the budget funds
   is released and can be directed to the implementation of other strategic
   and important projects in smart cities), providing benefits to projects
   to improve human security and energy conservation due to damage to
   energy infrastructure facilities, as well as social projects aimed at
   improving living conditions and social adaptation of people.},

Abstract = {Many countries and governments consider smart cities a solution to
   global warming, population growth, and resource depletion. Numerous
   challenges arise while creating a smart city. Digital twins, along with
   the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless systems, blockchain,
   collaborative computing, simulation, and artificial intelligence
   technologies, offer great potential in the transformation of the current
   urban governance paradigm toward smart cities. In this paper, the
   concept of a digital twin city (DTC) is proposed. The characteristics,
   key technologies, and application scenarios of a DTC are elaborated
   upon. Further, we discuss the theories, research directions, and
   framework regarding DTCs. (c) 2021 China Science Publishing \& Media

Abstract = {In theory, informatization construction can optimize resource allocation
   and improve total factor productivity through changing urban
   organizational structure and production mode. Based on the quasinatural
   experiment of smart city pilot policy, this paper employs kernel
   propensity score matching and difference-indifference (KPSM-DID) method
   to test whether it improves the urban total factor productivity with
   data of China's 171 cities during 2006-2016 period. The results show
   that: (1) On average, the smart city pilot policy plays a significant
   role in promoting the city's technical change (TC), and the impact on
   efficiency change (EC) is positive but not significant. Their coupling
   effect promotes the growth of urban total factor productivity. (2)
   Government financial expenditure has significant negative influence on
   total factor productivity, while industrial structure and infrastructure
   have significant positive effects on total factor productivity. (3)
   Heterogeneity research shows that the smart city pilot policy is more
   conducive to promoting the growth of total factor productivity in
   eastern cities and high-innovation cities, but it is difficult to
   improve the level of total factor productivity in western cities and
   low-innovation cities. (4) From the various forms of robustness tests,
   it can be seen that the smart city pilot policy has significantly
   promoted the growth of urban total factor productivity in both
   statistical and economic sense.},

Abstract = {An operational model for Arctic smart city living laboratory is
   presented and discussed. The model is a change-promoting process meant
   for the public city organization, operating in the context of smart
   cities, open innovation ecosystem and spatial planning. The entire city
   functions as a living laboratory scene with the principles of
   anticipatory action learning. The four urban development practices pace
   the exploration and exploitation of the opportunities and advantages for
   the city. As the public landowner, the city builds capacity for
   enhancing and applying innovations. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Rankings for smart city dialogue? Opening up a critical scrutiny},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC BUDGETING ACCOUNTING \& FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to explore whether and how contemporary rankings
   reflect the dialogic development of smart cities.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on the synthesis of
   smart city (SC), rankings and dialogic accounting literature. It first
   analyses ranking documents and related methodologies and measures and
   then reflects on four SC rankings, taking a critical stand on whether
   they provide space for the polyphonic development of smart cities.
   Findings This study argues that rankings do not include divergent
   perspectives and visions of smart cities, trapping cities in a mirage of
   multiple voices and bringing about a lack of urban stakeholder
   engagement. In other words, there is a gap between the democratic
   demands on smart cities and what rankings provide to governments when it
   comes to dialogue. As such, rankings in their existing traditional and
   technocratic form do not serve the dynamic and complex nature of the SC
   agenda. This, in turn, raises the threat that rankings create a
   particular notion of smartness across urban development with no
   possibility of questioning it. Originality/value The paper responds to
   recent calls to critically examine the concept of the SC and the role
   that accounting has played in its development. This study brings new
   insights regarding the value of dialogic accounting in shaping a
   contemporary understanding of rankings and their criticalities in the SC
   agenda.},

Abstract = {Purpose Benchmarks provide a strategic tool for assessing the
   sustainability impacts of urban development. Addressing the need for
   practitioners to evaluate their initiatives, track progress and
   determine their competitive position, this paper aims to introduce the
   conception and implementation of a smart city maturity assessment and
   benchmarking tool. Design/methodology/approach Following a design
   science approach, application objectives are defined based on a review
   of literature and related benchmarking tools. Focusing on a subset of
   functions for the prototype version, these objectives are
   operationalized by development of a smart mobility maturity model,
   indicator set and survey. A two-step evaluation by means of a test run
   using data of five cities and expert interviews confirms the tool's
   functionality. Findings Compliance with the defined objectives is
   achieved by implementation of a Web-based self-assessment tool using
   objective indicators. Future development iterations are to integrate
   additional smart city action fields.
   Originality/value Enabling practitioners to self-evaluate their
   initiatives, providing the option to track progress and supplying
   guidance for improving a city' standing, the proposed solution
   represents a novel form of knowledge transfer.},

Abstract = {Startup companies have experienced an extreme growth in the recent
   years. Popularity of innovative entrepreneurship, amount of investments
   into innovations and potential reinforcement of economic growth has
   attracted the attention of corporate sector as well as government
   institutions and local municipalities. Creation of suitable environment
   for innovative entrepreneurship and peculiar start-ups has become much
   more significant over the last 15 years. From the academic point of
   view, this topic is rather new. Regarding the local self-governments,
   the creation of suitable environment and concept of the ecosystem for
   startups represent only one of the many key issues of city's
   development. Smart city is another distinctive movement that comes to
   the core. The main question dealt with in this paper is to what extent
   the targets related to the implementation of smart cities concept
   relates to the process of start-up ecosystem creation. Is there any
   relation between the indicators observing the level of smart cities and
   the factors based on which the suitability of startup ecosystems are
   evaluated? The link between both concepts is assumed based on the close
   interconnection of both approaches and IT technologies and
   computerisation of natural environment of the given city.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study seeks to explore the powerful role(s) of
   institutionalised performance measurement systems or metrics in smart
   city governance in a politically and militarily sensitive developing
   country. Design/methodology/approach This study extends the application
   and contribution of a multi-level institutional framework to previous
   management accounting literature on the potential relationship between
   performance measurement and smart city governance. The value of
   utilising a multi-level framework is to broaden and deepen theoretical
   analyses about this relationship to include the effect of political
   pressure from the military regime at the macro level on the
   institutionalisation of a performance measurement system at the
   micro-organisational level. Taking the New Cairo city council smart
   electricity networks project (Egypt) as an interpretive qualitative
   single-case study, data collection methods included semi-structured
   interviews, direct observations and documentary readings. Findings
   Performance measurement systems or metrics, especially in politically
   and militarily sensitive smart cities, constitutes a process of
   cascading (macro-micro) institutionalisation that is closely linked to
   sustainable developments taking place in the wider arena of urban
   policies. Going a step further, accounting-based performance metrics,
   arising from political and military pressures towards public-private
   collaborations, contribute to smart city management and accountability
   (governance). Institutionalised measurement systems or performance
   metrics play a powerful accounting role(s) in shaping and reshaping
   political decisions and military actions in the city council.
   Originality/value Theoretically, this study goes beyond the cascading
   institutionalisation process by arguing for the powerful role(s) of
   institutionalised accounting and performance measurement systems in
   smart city decision-making and governance. Empirically, it enriches
   previous literature with a case study of a developing Arab Spring
   country, characterised by an emerging economy, political sensitivity and
   military engagement, rather than developed and more stable countries
   that have been thoroughly investigated. It is also among the first
   politically engaged accounting case studies to highlight public-private
   collaborations as a recent reform in public sector governance and
   accountability.},

Abstract = {Wuhan, an important transportation hub city in the middle of China, has
   always been known as ``thoroughfare to nine provinces{''}. It has
   outstanding advantages in obtaining large passenger flow data and the
   development of smart tourism. This paper probes into the position of
   Wuhan's unique transportation hub, analyzes the problems existing in its
   development of smart tourism, and puts forward three countermeasures for
   the development of Wuhan smart tourism based on big data. Firstly, Wuhan
   should take advantage of traffic big data to improve the public service
   facilities. Secondly, strengthen the smart vehicle management to create
   humanized service environment. Lastly, broaden the intelligent network
   coverage to provide personalized service experience for tourists.},

Title = {Solutions to Manage Smart Cities' Risks in Times of Pandemic Crisis},
Journal = {RISKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper was to investigate technologies, methods, and
   approaches that can be used to effectively manage smart city risks in
   the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper was based on a review of
   specialized literature sources and expert statements on smart cities in
   times of crisis, specifically during COVID-19. A systematic literature
   review served as the research's methodological foundation; this was
   supplemented by conceptual data analysis techniques and a modeling
   method. Our initial search yielded 234 research articles, 38 of which
   met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. A further 32
   studies fell outside of the criteria for supporting smart cities' crisis
   management. The main findings showed that technologies can respond
   quickly to pandemic crisis risks while also ensuring the availability of
   urban functionality and that there are numerous risks in implementing
   technologies to achieve effective management. The main risks were
   privacy concerns, social inclusion, political bias, misinformation and
   fake news, and technical difficulties with education and distance
   employment. The practical significance of the paper lay in proposing a
   model based on specific technologies and policies aimed at effective
   risk management in the days of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {In most countries, the building of infrastructure is a centralized
   activity, government-led actions that have as their objectives
   sequential problem solving - such as the construction of a water supply
   system or sewerage network. Smart infrastructure solutions should also
   be added as components to anticipate global and medium-term phenomena.
   The city infrastructure must resist the pressures given by the
   increasingly rapid technological evolution - for example, electricity
   grids must take into account the growing number of users installing
   their own electric panels - a phenomenon that, on the long run, leads to
   consumption reduction, as well as climate change, which, due to the
   increasing temperature differences between seasons and the increasingly
   abundant rainfall, tend to cause heavy damage to the electricity
   transmission infrastructure. Smart cities need to isolate their
   infrastructure from these events. They may need to build new networks or
   adjust the old ones in such a way as to meet the new challenges. Within
   some of the most prestigious research centers, scientists formulated the
   most comprehensive definition of the concept, namely: Smart
   Infrastructure is the result of combining physical and digital
   infrastructure elements to provide valuable information to help make
   decisions faster and at lower costs. In this article, we will focus on
   the latest technological elements that are meant to improve the lives of
   citizens of a smart city.},

Abstract = {Rising urbanization is a challenge for sustainable urban development.
   The UN predicts 70\% of urban population by 2050, 80\% of global
   emissions, 75\% of energy consumption. Sustainable development can not
   be achieved without significant change in the way we build and manage
   our urban areas. Against the background of economic and technological
   changes caused by the globalization and the integration process, cities
   in Europe face the challenge of combining competitiveness and
   sustainable urban development simultaneously. Very evidently, this
   challenge is likely to have an impact on issues of urban quality
   droughts and housing, economy, culture, social and environmental
   conditions. This paper focuces on smart cities concept in the Czech
   Republic, the transformation, examples and possibilites of economic
   support.},

Abstract = {Nowadays many city governance bodies struggling to understand the vast
   array of issues that are coming their way - climate change, global
   warming, poverty, real estate, education, traffic, resource depletion,
   etc. And they increasingly face a need for `new thinking', realizing
   that governmental decisions have long-term impacts. In addition,
   effectiveness of cooperation in field of efficient solution transfer
   becomes important among cities. The aim of the article is to show the
   concept, features, advantages and opportunities of the intellectual city
   environment in order to achieve new and qualitative development. To
   reflect the essence of `smart city' and `intellectual city' concepts,
   authors use literature review and overview. Main research results show
   that the use of positive synergies strengthens existing urban components
   and creates new ones. They improve the quality of the processes by
   developing the economic potential of cities and territories. The
   governance of the intellectual city is organized by different city
   management models. Model for strategic development of urban environment
   can help achieve the effect of synergy. True synergy effect in the
   intellectual urban environment is a change-oriented system. Authors
   offer their view of synergy of intelligence in `intellectual city' in
   21st century, which is reflected as an interaction between human and
   artificial intelligence. That relates with culture, global
   connectedness, control, investments, technology and innovations. The
   results show that `intellectual cities' are built with high intensity
   support from government. Support is aimed to improve prosperity and life
   quality of citizens. These are key indicators that reflect opinion of
   voter about governance in election period.},

Abstract = {The subject of this paper is data streaming in IoT crowdsensing systems.
   The goal of this paper is to present a way of designing a scalable IoT
   crowdsensing system that enables design of various business models for
   smart city projects. The system designed in such a way is capable of
   handling an increasing number of users while maintaining acceptable
   performance. Performance of the system can be measured in response
   latency, which allows for real-time tracking of crowdsensing parameters.
   The first part of the paper deals with data streaming concepts and
   software solutions, with a particular focus on Apache Kafka. The second
   part presents the designed system for crowdsensing in smart city
   environments. The designed system allows for use of mobile and Arduino
   devices as input data for the Kafka cloud cluster in order to provide
   crowdsourcing insights in real-time. The primary way that users can
   utilize these insights is through a web or mobile application, where
   various data visualizations can be presented. The development of a
   system based on the proposed model can allow for easy access to recent
   crowdsourced data, and real-time smart city indicators such as air
   pollution.},

Abstract = {The widespread adoption of digital technologies in finance has led to
   the development of new financial instruments. Digital technologies offer
   benefits such as faster transactions, increased consumer satisfaction,
   and greater competitiveness of financial institutions. The article
   examines the latest forms of Fintech and their distribution in smart
   cities, as well as the implementation of smart projects. It is important
   to note that any subjective evaluations have been excluded from this
   analysis. The article systematises the main directions and forms of
   application of modern financial technologies. These include payments,
   lending, investing, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, assessment, and
   analytics. Payment systems and applications that allow online payments,
   money transfers, and cashless transactions fall under the payments
   category. Crowdfunding, peer -topeer lending, and microfinance are forms
   of lending. Investment robots and smart portfolios are automated
   platforms that fall under investing. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are
   technologies that allow transactions with cryptocurrencies. Innovative
   methods of assessing the creditworthiness of clients and providing loans
   fall under the assessment and analytics category. Implementing projects
   in smart cities requires significant resources. To expand the financial
   capacity of local authorities, the following tools are used: public
   financing, partnerships with the private sector, crowdfunding,
   international programs and initiatives, investment funds, loans, and
   partnerships with academic and research institutions. Fintech has
   advantages, but it also poses threats and challenges such as cyber
   threats, personal data protection, risks of illegal operations, and
   psychological aspects. Appropriate actions are necessary to prevent and
   address these issues, and further research is needed.},

Abstract = {Nowadays cities have to confront inevitably the consequences of
   globalization. Due to the significant impact they have on the
   development level of a country, these major population centres, are now
   competing with each other, sometimes at international levels, to attract
   investments and knowledge workers at the time they are facing social
   challenges. As a result, many governments in cities are currently
   initiating Smart City (SC) projects with the aim of addressing the rapid
   urbanization's issues, but with little agreement on what the SC concept
   actually represents and the way in which it should be implemented. In
   this context, citizens, who are supposed to be key players in this
   global change process, remain at times reluctant, at times foreign to
   it. This research paper analyses citizens' knowledge on the concept of
   SC and the four basic elements of what it is composed. In order to
   address this purpose, a self-administered questionnaire was conducted
   with a sample of individuals in Northwest Spain. Findings support this
   previous premise: citizens show a lack of awareness of the concept and
   the role of its main dimensions, apart from a poor involvement in public
   SC projects. Lastly, a final discussion is carried out gathering some
   interest considerations.},

Title = {Governing the ``good citizen{''} and shaping the ``model city{''} to

Abstract = {Purpose Cities are key actors in the fight against climate change. They
   have developed integrated strategies harnessing the power of information
   and communication technologies (ICT) as part of the move towards
   smart(er) cities. In spite of our knowledge of the role of technological
   infrastructure in tackling climate change, the role of governance
   mechanisms to actively pursue environmental sustainability is often
   understated. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse
   governmentality mechanisms developed by a small town in Europe to render
   energy savings and new energy sources visible and to create new
   identities with which the citizen and other cities could then identify
   with, thereby participating in the fight against climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered through non-participant
   observation, interviews and access to internal data from the city's
   energy control project. Findings The outcome of these governmentality
   mechanisms was to create two new identities: the ``good citizen{''},
   responsible to lower his impact on climate change, and the ``model
   city{''}, a laboratory that would serve as a guide for future policies
   to tackle climate change at the city level. While the ``model city{''}
   was successful and identification happened with other small cities
   taking example from it, the ``good citizen{''} failed and inhabitants
   did not identify with this role model that was defined for them as a way
   to participate in the fight against climate change.
   Originality/value The case study contributes to the literature on
   cities, bringing new insights into how they can become actors of climate
   change beyond acting on internal controls, and the literature on
   governmentality by demonstrating how mechanisms can act upon a
   population without being calculative.},

Abstract = {Urban areas have to face many problems rising from the concentration of
   people on limited space. Solving these problems is a matter for the
   public administration, especially those serious issues as unemployment,
   security, scarcity of housing, air pollution, etc. However, digital
   technologies enabled citizens to participate on solving some issues
   visible to them. Citizen reporting systems offer citizens fast and very
   simple way to draw attention to a problem in a particular territory
   (damaged benches, mess, broken pavement, uncut grass, landfills, etc.).
   We can distinguish mainly three types of citizen reporting systems: web
   based; module, which is part of city mobile application; and specialized
   mobile application for issue reporting. Such systems use citizens as
   sensing devices gathering data that help cities make their operations
   more flexible. This way of participation activates people to care about
   place they live - their city. Smart cities need active people who care
   and feel responsible for the city that is why the participation is one
   of main pillars of smart cities. Through the literature review, this
   article summarizes the use of citizen reporting systems in the global
   context and compares it with the situation in the Czech Republic.
   Analysis of city applications of regional capitals reveals if they use
   some citizen reporting system and if yes, which types do cities use.},

Abstract = {``Smart Region{''} is a new paradigm of improving the competitiveness
   and security of the regional economy at the present stage, the
   transition to which is not fully possible without the ``smart{''}
   modernization of housing management systems. The search and
   justification of ``smart{''} areas of modernization of housing
   management systems is a relevant and popular direction of scientific
   researches in solving the problems of improving competitiveness and
   security of the regional economy.
   The purpose of the study is the theoretical and methodological
   justification of approaches to the ``smart{''} modernization of housing
   management systems as the condition for increasing the competitiveness
   and security of the regional economy. To achieve the main purpose, the
   tasks were solved: the assessment of the current state of the housing
   stock and management systems was given; the problems preventing the
   process of ``smart{''} modernization of housing management systems were
   identified; the proposals for the ``smart{''} modernization of housing
   management systems based on the comparative experience of successful
   practices were developed and justified.
   The object of the study is the housing stock on the example of a typical
   region and the city of the Southern Federal District, the subject is the
   external and internal factors, the processes of ``smart{''}
   modernization of housing management systems. The obtained results and
   conclusions are characterized by novelty, scientific and practical
   importance in terms of substantiation of the concept of ``smart{''}
   modernization of the housing stock as the condition for a competitive,
   safe and sustainable development of the region's economy. To carry out
   effective ``smart{''} modernization of housing management systems, the
   project has been developed which include the creation of unified
   information space through the creation of the information and consulting
   portal site - the main platform for interaction between all participants
   of housing management processes at the regional and city levels.},

Abstract = {The tourism sector has gained increasing importance in the economy of
   many regions, or even countries, however, the way in which organizations
   and territories communicate and promote each other, to attract tourists,
   significantly impacts the success of the sector, and digital marketing
   strategies have stood out as promising. Thus, in a digital society, in
   which information and communication technologies are present in the
   daily life of the general population, especially mobile technologies, it
   is essential that the tourism sector seeks innovative and
   differentiating marketing and communication strategies. When considering
   the technological advances, which have been asserted lately, wireless
   communication networks with high bandwidth, processing capacity of
   mobile technologies, Internet of Things, Big Data, Virtual and Augmented
   Reality, Empowered Smart Cities with different technology; it can be
   said that the conditions are in place so that new paradigms and
   marketing strategies can emerge. These technologies allow to communicate
   with the target audience in a more impactful way and stimulating
   different senses, that is, immersive. It is in this context that the
   opportunity and motivation for the development of this research work
   arises. In this sense, this work highlights the technologies that we
   consider most relevant, combining them in a conceptual model that is
   proposed and that we consider enhancing an immersive and innovative
   digital marketing strategy, for the promotion of touristic destinations.},

Abstract = {Purpose As smart technologies become an integral part of real estate in
   smart cities, the purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of
   ubiquitous computing on space users in smart real estate.
   Design/methodology/approach The analysis builds on two fields of
   knowledge rarely referenced in real estate studies: computer sciences
   and social sciences. The paper starts by analysing the idiosyncrasies of
   a new type of space user in smart real estate, known as the Cyber-dasein
   in reference to Heidegger's phenomenology. The Cyber-dasein serves as an
   archetypical space user in smart environments. Findings The paper
   introduces digital-time as a new realm of real estate, and discusses the
   use of ``experienced utility{''} in hedonic pricing models of smart real
   estate. It concludes by advocating a multidisciplinary collaborative
   approach for future research on real estate in smart environments.
   Practical implications There is a need for the real estate sector to
   decide on a metric for the new digital dimension of real estate owing to
   the implementation of smart technologies in the built environment.
   Originality/value This is the first research paper on this important
   topic. It is totally original and new.},

Abstract = {State security has the important role of maintaining a stable and secure
   environment in the society. Using modern technologies, known like
   establishing concept of the smart city, increase public security. The
   concept of the smart city is one of principle of sustainable
   development. It means a city, which for their own organization use
   modern technologies for increasing the life quality and doing government
   that is more effective. Due to current global changes, there are
   significant changes to state security. Problems can be found with
   restrictions and law, but government wants to react on actual security
   trends. In addition, financial part of this concept can be problem for
   little cities, which want to react on the new trend also, but their
   funding is not enough for establishing the new technologies. The paper
   maps the most important world trends in modern technologies using;
   related to this kind of security. The aim of the paper is to evaluate
   the use of modern technologies for security in the public sector taking
   into account current global change and their future prediction. Part of
   the article is a case study on public security focused on the use of
   biometrics at the airports and suggestions to improve identified
   deficiencies because increasing the safety of airport procedures, using
   biometric systems, is a key solution for the future.},

Title = {Social Equity and Urban Housing Policy Failures: Evaluation for
   Rehabilitation and Housing Resettlement Plans and Policies in Indian
   Cities},
Journal = {REVIEW OF PACIFIC BASIN FINANCIAL MARKETS AND POLICIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Today's Indian cities are confronted with a wide range of problems due
   to social equity and urban housing policy failures, including rising
   populations, shifting family structures, increasing numbers of people
   living in informal communities and slums, inadequate urban
   infrastructure, growing environmental concerns, and an increase in
   migration. India has a severe housing shortage. A significant chasm
   separates housing demand from the supply. The discrepancy has led to the
   proliferation of urban slums, where millions of people are subjected to
   the lowest sanitation and hygiene standards. Housing policies in Indian
   cities include increasing taxes on unused or uninhabited land to fund
   the construction of low-cost dwellings, altering zoning laws to mandate
   that builders, and promoting higher densities of houses to spread out
   infrastructure costs among a larger population. Many people who have
   been the beneficiaries of land acquisition or other forms of forcible
   relocation are eligible for assistance through the Rehabilitation and
   Housing Resettlement Program. The proposed method included the city's
   slums in the Advanced Smart Urban Missions (ASUM) planning process to
   overcome housing policy failures. A three-dimensional social equity
   framework with dispersion, identification, and protocol dimension
   aspects is applied to evaluate formal recovery plans' objectives,
   priorities, and tactics. One of the most critical aspects of providing
   more housing alternatives for more people is ensuring everyone can
   afford it. Human rights, different perspectives, development initiatives
   in India, and policy inclusivity were also investigated. It makes
   suggestions for improving intelligent city policy that considers the
   needs of the city's disadvantaged populations. This study looks into the
   problems that slum dwellers have with relocation and evictions and is
   limited to establishing various Smart Urban Missions. The research will
   help streamline the intelligent city development process sequentially,
   improving conditions for the urban poor and disadvantaged.},

Abstract = {The study is given to the use of dynamic regression model for the
   improvement of infrastructure for electric cars. Purpose of research is
   the use of a dynamic regression model to identify the influence of
   chargers to the number of electric cars. To reach the goal, the author
   focuses on the improvement of availability of chargers and the
   minimisation of distance between charging points. Research methodology
   is based on the application of dynamic regression method to forecast the
   park of electric cars in Lithuania. The author suggests a dynamic
   regression model and accompanies it with autocorrelation and
   heteroskedasticity tests: Breush-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM Test for
   autocorrelation and ARCH test for heteroskedasticity. During analysis
   author identifies the relationship between the number of chargers and
   the number of electric cars. The author delivers a specific regression
   model to estimate the improvement of chargers' infrastructure on the
   park of electric cars. Probability F and Probability Chi-Square of this
   testing show that there is no significant autocorrelation and
   heteroskedasticity. Presented framework could be useful for
   practitioners, which forecast the number of electric cars in cities. The
   presented regression model could be used for forecasting the expansion
   of park of electric cars in Lithuania.},

Abstract = {Brand of city in the form of vision, different symbols and before the
   all reputation and unmistakable identity is a long process. The results
   of building a city or region identity determine economic and social
   sustainability, competitiveness, real estate market or demographic
   development. Municipal management often resigns from active policy
   setting of housing. Housing is, however, the key function of the city.
   Although the tools of strategic planning of cities are not all-powerful,
   in long-term horizon they can be cleverly using for brand and reputation
   building and location value growing. The identity of the city (district)
   influences the quality of life of its inhabitants. Maintaining an
   attractive community identity depends directly on the smart direction of
   development and the ability to influence the physical space and urban
   character in the locality. The reality of public investments management
   and processes of negotiation with developers often ignores the long-term
   strategic public interest of the city and only address economic aspects
   and limits of the master plan. Other qualitative aspects of public
   investments are excluded usually from considerations, and the way to
   develop ``brand{''} is seen just in PR campaigns rather than the quality
   of city development. This article reflects a case study of one of the
   edge of the capital city of Prague - Kolovraty. The management of the
   Prague - Kolovraty district prepared a strategic plan in cooperation
   with the Czech Technical University in Prague. A key paradigm of this
   strategic plan is the effort to preserve the identity of the city and
   its goodwill.},

Abstract = {In today s cutthroat business environment, implementation of innovative
   technology solutions can mean winning a competitive edge. At this, brick
   and mortar stores are no exception. Shoppers expect their shopping in a
   store to be a special experience. In addition, they also want to be
   effective at shopping. Stores are trying to get closer to them with
   their arrangements and content. The main goal of every kind of a shop is
   promotion of sales. It is important that shops have something to keep
   customers in the store as long as possible to see and spend more that
   they planned on the entrance. Consequently, an intensive search for new
   technological solutions is underway. Paper studies the implementation of
   smart glasses with voice support, as one of viable technological
   solution, in a brick and mortar shop environment. Advantages as reduced
   time for dull routine tasks and faster decision making spent are
   expected. There is also a strong possibility to facilitate the search of
   the wanted product true voice pick support. Based on the study of the
   use of smart glasses in other industries and in private life, we are
   looking for functionalities that could be used in stores. In addition,
   we analyse available scientific studies on the use of smart glasses. The
   research goal is to define advantages, disadvantages, opportunities and
   challenges of implementation of smart glasses for customers in shop
   environment. Conclusions will also base on live experiment in which we
   used Vuzix M300 smart glasses for picking of good from shelves. The
   result of the research will be given in the form of recommendation for
   practise and science.},

Abstract = {Globalization and good governance influence each other. Good governance
   can attract global activities. On the other hand, globalization can
   support an increase of the level of the governance. Good governance is a
   pre-condition for sustainable development at the regional, national, and
   global levels. Simultaneously, it is a component of the development of a
   society. Public administration authorities as governance bodies make
   many decisions. Most of the decisions are spatially oriented, i.e. they
   include a particular location. Thus, geographic information systems
   (GIS) are used as a tool for data processing. Web-based GIS systems are
   widely used as a tool offering an interactive presentation of spatial
   data to inhabitants. Some of the solutions can also allow citizens to
   take an active role, e. g. to submit some information like reporting
   faults in the city. These applications support several key attributes of
   good governance: participation, responsiveness, transparency, and
   accountability. The case study provides an overview of how Web-based GIS
   are used by municipalities to inform or include inhabitants into public
   activities and affairs. Two former districts in the Pardubicky region,
   the Czech Republic, are chosen for the case study. These two districts
   consist in total of 227 municipalities. The number of inhabitants varies
   from 52 to 90 335 so both very small and large municipalities are
   included. The covered municipalities use five different commercial
   Web-based GIS solutions. The solutions are compared from the point of
   view of available functionality and a level of inhabitant involvement.
   Possible links to the size of cities are discussed. Some results are
   visualised by maps.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper examines the link between the failure of public
   accountability and stakeholder disengagement brought about by a New
   Public Management (NPM) style ``smart solution{''} introduced to reduce
   public urination in Dhaka city. It shows how New Public Governance
   (NPG), Islamic and dialogic approaches can improve decision-making and
   solutions.Design/methodology/approachDrawing on the concepts of public
   accountability, NPM, NPG and dialogic accountability, this study
   highlights how narrow conceptions of accountability and poor stakeholder
   engagement impacted the effectiveness of the ``smart solution{''} based
   on data collected through observation and unstructured in-depth
   interviews.FindingsEvidence suggests that narrow conceptions of
   accountability driven by monologic NPM perspectives led to poor
   stakeholder engagement, which impacted the effectiveness of the ``smart
   solution{''}. The solution that consists of changing anti-urination
   signage from Bengali to Arabic script has not solved Dhaka's public
   urination problem. In many instances, the solution has disenchanted
   certain stakeholders who view it as an offence against Islam and a
   confusing de-privileging of the Bengali language which has significant
   national and cultural value in Bangladesh.Originality/valueThe findings
   of the study contribute to policymaking discussions on how to
   effectively engage with stakeholders and extend the literature on
   accountability within the context of conflicting public versus private
   demands related to a public nuisance. The study outlines important
   issues related to stakeholder engagement and introduces a framework that
   conceptualises how to increase the effectiveness of public policy
   decisions using NPG, Islamic and dialogic accountability approaches,
   especially on matters that require significant public/external
   stakeholder support. It also provides a conceptual integration of these
   various approaches, including nuanced insights into accountability
   challenges within ``non-Western{''} contexts.},

Abstract = {The topic of this paper is the practical application of global
   benchmarking systems, in the field of public administration and
   especially in the development of municipalities and regions in global
   environment. The objective of the authors was to highlight the
   importance of applied strategic approach in municipalities and regions
   in a global environment as one of the important topics in the sector.
   The authors reviewed the application of benchmarking in real conditions
   of the Slovak Republic in period 2005 - 2017. In this paper they present
   real life cases and researches in 40 cities in total, representing 42\%
   of the urban population of Slovakia. Trends in urban and regional
   management are based on general trends in public administration,
   nevertheless are these at the same time characterized by some
   specificities. The general global trends include the strategic approach
   applications, the client orientation, and the value-based service
   orientation. A specific global trends is the shift from the perception
   of cities and regions as territorial units to urban regions as natural
   spatial units. The management of organizations in a constantly changing
   global environment requires a certain set of navigation tools and
   indicators to assess the situation from different perspectives and to
   monitor how organizations achieve their set global strategic goals.},

Title = {Factors of Risk Analysis for IoT Systems},
Journal = {RISKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The increasing rate at which IoT technologies are being developed has
   enabled smarter and innovative solutions in the sectors of health,
   energy, transportation, etc. Unfortunately, some inherent
   characteristics of these technologies are compromised to attack.
   Naturally, risk analysis emerges, as it is one of many steps to provide
   a reliable security strategy. However, the methodologies of any risk
   analysis must first adapt to the dynamics of the IoT system. This
   article seeks to shed light on whatever factors are part of an IoT
   system and thus contribute to security risks, IoT device
   vulnerabilities, susceptibility due to the application domain, attack
   surfaces, and interdependence as a product of the interconnection
   between IoT devices. Consequently, the importance of these factors in
   any risk evaluation is highlighted, especially the interdependence
   generated by IoT systems, which can cause the generation of an
   uncontrollable cascade of effects that can occur under certain
   conditions of any systematic risk event.},

Abstract = {The article defines the key aspects of methodical support of financial
   management of entrepreneurial universities in the conditions of
   digitalization, smart economy and development of educational tourism.
   Attention is focused on the fact that at this time Ukraine faced complex
   phenomena caused by the invasion of the Russian Federation on the
   territory of our state, which caused powerful changes in all sectors,
   industries and industries of Ukraine. It was noted that against the
   background of active digitalization and financial instability, migration
   shifts and the flow of human resources took place. In this context,
   there is a need for an active policy of creating and evaluating the
   effectiveness of the concept of financial management of entrepreneurial
   universities in the conditions of digitalization, smart economy and the
   development of educational tourism, taking into account the challenges
   faced by the modern economy of Ukraine. With the use of methods of
   production functions, the article proposes an assessment of the
   financial management of entrepreneurial universities. It was noted a
   need to increase the financial support of entrepreneurial universities,
   which is important for improving the quality of education and tax
   revenues at the regional and state levels. Attention is focused on the
   phenomenon of increased outflow of students outside of Ukraine with the
   simultaneous outflow of teaching staff abroad. It was noted that it is
   the effective financial policy of supporting entrepreneurial
   universities that can reduce negative phenomena in education.},

Title = {CONCEPTUAL PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL OF THE LOCAL BUDGETS

Abstract = {External threats (Russian-Ukrainian war, climate change on the planet,
   consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic) and internal factors (lack of
   funding, inefficient use of funds, inconsistency of powers of the
   executive power at different levels) lead to unbalanced adoption of
   budget decisions at the local level in Ukraine. A major role in
   overcoming such bottlenecks lies in rethinking the functions of
   accounting and control. The purpose of the article is to find new
   conceptual approaches that will improve the efficiency of municipalities
   based on providing the management of the territorial community with
   complete, accurate and operational data. The authors analyze the
   publications for 1946-2022 from SCOPUS by computer program VOSviewer,
   using methods of content analysis and clustering. In addition, the
   authors use a number of scientific methods: analysis and synthesis,
   induction and deduction, the system method, analogies, etc. The study
   deals with a number of problems and solutions implemented by
   municipalities during wartime, related to local budgets. The influence
   of natural factors, sustainable development, accounting and control on
   ensuring the manageability of budgets of territorial communities has
   been clarified. The authors propose a new conceptual approach to the
   organization of the budgetary process of territorial communities, which
   is based on the concept of STEM. For its practical implementation, it is
   recommended to apply the smart city concept. The study identifies the
   main advantages and caveats regarding its implementation in Ukraine. The
   practical significance of the obtained results lies in the possibility
   of improving accounting and control of local budgets.},

Abstract = {Edward Everett Gore was the president of the American Institute of
   Accountants (now AICPA) from 1922 to 1924 He served on the AICPA Council
   from 1916 until his death in 1935. At the same time he was leading the
   accounting profession, he was the president of the Chicago Association
   of Commerce. He was later founder and president of the Chicago Crime
   Commission during the era when Alphonse Capone was terrorizing the city.
   He was responsible for the passage of the first Illinois CPA law and for
   the establishment of the Journal of Accountancy and for the AICPA
   Benevolent Fund. He wrote portions of the 1913 tax law and campaigned
   for the establishment of the Internal Revenue's Board of Tax Appeals
   (Tax Court). Gore entered public accounting in 1897 and later became a
   partner in the venerable firm of Barrow, Wade \& Guthrie. He left that
   firm to form Smart, Gore \& Company in 1922.},

Abstract = {Since smart phones has become popular, we have been introduced to a huge
   volume of mobile applications. Every day, we are able to find a new
   mobile application for different purposes. With these applications, we
   can edit our photos or contact people on social networks. The main aim
   of this study is to determine the students' opinions on Tourism impact
   using Mobile Applications. In line with this aim, the authors developed
   a 5-point Likert-type scale consisting of 20 positive statements. The
   scale was administered to 352 distance learning students during the
   2014-2015 spring terms at Near East University. Data were analyzed with
   IBM SPSS 22. The results showed that students prefer Trip Advisor
   application to find historical places and they select places to visit
   after they read user comments. Students also revealed that booking.com
   are more reliable than other applications. Besides, students prefer to
   download maps applications and they use GPS when they travel the cities.

Abstract = {In the framework of Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and
   inclusive growth and of recent growth related theories we analyse the
   extent to which secondtier cities as growth poles contribute to the
   growth of the country with focus on EU member states. We conduct an
   analysis of the development of secondtier cities from the countries with
   similar level of development as Romania, with focus especially on
   employment related issues. The selection of growth poles will be done
   using clustering of EU member states for year 2010 based on the headline
   indicators from the Europe 2020 strategy (employment, research and
   development, climate change and energy sustainability, education,
   poverty and social exclusion) and resource productivity as lead
   indicator for resource efficiency, so as to highlight the different
   levels of development among EU countries. In order to ensure higher
   level of accuracy in clustering, from economic perspective we also
   include other indicators, such as GDP per capita and the index of
   economic freedom. (C) The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The development of modern forms of urban mobility is a response to the
   aggravated problems of living comfort in urban areas, associated with an
   extremely high load on all urban services in conditions of increasing
   not only passenger traffic, but also extremely rapid obsolescence of
   transport infrastructure, which is not coping with the efficient
   organisation of transport flows. The development of an integrated
   transport system based on the use of platform solutions for mobility
   provides not only the maximum availability and comfort of transport
   services, but also the formation of sustainable urban transport systems
   with minimal environmental impact. The analysis of the existing
   experience in applying modern business models for the development of
   public transport will determine priority areas for the further
   development of urban transport systems. The use of ``smart{''}
   technologies for managing the city's transport system creates a
   qualitatively new environment based on the development of ``human
   capital{''} and the spread of innovation. The intellectualisation of the
   work of transport systems in the city is a complex system of
   interconnected innovations: technological, organisational and economic
   (various forms of cooperation between the government, government,
   private business and public organisations), new financial models
   (public-private partnerships, paid services, financing from economic
   results, new and including digital services), etc.},

Abstract = {It is substantiated that the factor of economic growth, increase of
   economic and energy security, preservation of the environment from the
   detrimental impact of the consequences of consumption of hydrocarbon
   energy sources is the sustainable development of renewable energy. The
   state and prospects of using renewable energy sources in the world are
   considered (RES). The rating of countries by the share of electricity
   produced from renewable sources as a percentage of primary sources
   during 2015-2019 is presented, which shows that the largest share of RES
   is in countries such as: Iceland, Kenya and Latvia; Currently, the
   largest growth in renewable energy is observed in Ukraine, Great
   Britain, Turkey, Denmark, Japan, France, the USA and Germany. The
   generalized factors of growth of demand for renewable energy sources
   are: parity of the price and productivity owing to decrease in the price
   of RES; increasing the efficiency of energy production due to
   technological progress and the introduction of innovative technologies
   in foreign trade; integration of power grids and balancing the load on
   them; stimulating the demand for RES by large cities - the
   implementation of the strategy of ``smart city{''} includes ``smart{''}
   energy; development of public ownership of networks and sources of
   renewable energy; active participation of developing countries in the
   dissemination of renewable energy; growing participation of the
   corporate sector in the development of renewable energy.
   The relationship between the goals of energy development in terms of its
   accessibility, reliability, sustainability and goals in the field of
   sustainable development is determined. Thus, poverty reduction (goal 1)
   involves expanding access to basic resources and services and the
   availability of modern infrastructure, an element of which is RES; the
   use of clean renewable energy will help reduce health risks (disease
   prevention and pandemic control) (objective 3); creation of sustainable
   infrastructure, promotion of innovations (goal 9) involves the use of
   clean and environmentally friendly technologies and sustainable energy
   development; the use of RES activity has a synergistic connection with
   the implementation of goal 13 - urgent measures to combat climate change
   and its consequences.},

   However, the traditional tourism industry has many shortcomings, such as
   poor management level, unsmooth information transmission and the lack of
   information sharing. It is very important to develop the ``intelligent
   tourism{''} in this new era.
   Beijing is one of the first batches of national intelligent tourism
   pilot cities. The Beijing Municipal Tourism Development Committee
   officially released ``Beijing intelligent Tourism Action Plan
   (2012-2015){''} in 2012, which plans to use four years to improve the
   wisdom tourism development process vigorously in Beijing.
   In this study, we analyzed the specific conditions of the development of
   ``Intelligent Tourism{''} in Beijing using SWOT analysis method.

Abstract = {The paper discusses feasibility of the introduction of the digital
   economy in the country economy. Its levels are presented in the form of
   markets and sectors of national economies, platforms and technologies,
   where competencies for the development of markets and sectors of the
   economy are formed. Competencies include mobile devices, Big Data
   technologies and analysis of arrays of data on advanced algorithms,
   cloud services, Internet of things, quantum technologies, location
   technologies, robotics, wireless communication, virtual currencies, 3-D
   printing, smart sensors. Numerical technologies are listed and discussed
   in detail such as digitalization - ``smart{''} way of working for
   business, digital city, digital nation, digital state, digital finance,
   digital education, open data. The features of the digital economy
   include dependence on telecommunications networks and computer
   equipment, the basing of economic activity on the platforms of the
   ``Digital{''} economy, high growth rates of goods and services,
   personalized service data, direct interaction of producers and
   consumers. The models of digital economy development are proposed.
   Possible risks in the digitalization of national economies in the
   context of globalization are discussed, such as the rapid imposition and
   borrowing of Western technologies, the degradation of one's own
   competencies, the reduction of the level of data security, the loss of
   privacy, the reduction in the number of jobs of low and medium
   qualification, the increase in complexity of business models and
   interaction schemes, the sharp increase in competition in all spheres of
   the economy, the changes in the models of behavior of producers and
   consumers, the need to revise the administrative and tax codes.},

Abstract = {The last decade has been characterized by phenomenal scientific and
   technological changes, a dynamic digital transformation of business,
   networking of the economy and society. The methodological format of
   digital economy research is becoming relevant, taking into account, on
   the one hand, global trends of networking, intellectualization,
   individualization and digitalization, and on the other hand, the modern
   landscape of augmented and mixed reality within the virtual economy. Its
   scientific and practical issues are highlighted herewith within the
   concept of irreversibility of digital transformation grounding on
   generalization of modern theoretical developments. We expose here
   preconditions, factors and peculiarities of the digital economy
   formation. We place greater focus on business virtualization,
   blockchain, cryptocurrencies. We are trying to illustrate an imperative
   of computing in the digital economy in relation to the interface
   evolution. It is given herein assessment of further digitalization of
   industries, types and spheres of their activity, expectable trend of
   development of the digital economy towards virtual reality in the making
   and dynamic scaling of smart enterprises, cities and communities. We
   define reasonable grounds to the fact, that universities play a key role
   in the development of the intellectual capital, interacting with state
   and business within the system of open science, education and
   innovations. Scientific and practical value of the research centres on
   model validation of digital university development with digitalization
   of management system, educational and scientific activity, human capital
   development, infrastructure and creation of digital ecosystem based on

Abstract = {The educational sector is a special one which, like many others, has its
   particularities, needs and challenges. Among them there are poorly
   qualified teachers, the decline of school population, students' safety
   issues, corruption or underfunding, and the list does not end,
   unfortunately, here. All of these weaken social trust and erodes
   development. The computerization of the educational field is a problem
   that affects both the administrative activity and the personal
   development of students and teachers. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged
   us to find out what level of computer equipment Romanian schools have,
   referring only to pre-university education units (it was obvious to us
   that higher education have a completely different ``story{''}). This
   research study has only dealt with computers because performing a more
   complex analysis, including other types of smart educational equipment
   such as tablets, smart blackboards, interactive projectors, printers,
   laptops, would have required a larger data volume and more generous
   working time. The paper empirically analyses the relationship between
   the number of computers and the number of school units, on each level of
   study and by counties. The aim of this study was to verify both public
   and private systems from both environments: urban and rural. We used
   public data offered by the National Institute of Statistics from Romania
   and by the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, reported for the
   2018-2019 school year. All Romanian counties were analysed using SPSS
   application, excluding the city of Bucharest, due to the fact that it
   reflected an extreme (aberrant) value which would have distorted the
   ``behaviour of the series{''}.},

Abstract = {Sustainable finance and blockchain studies have garnered considerable
   interest recently. but there has been no systematic analysis of
   blockchain in sustainable finance to far. To fill this gap, based on the
   theme structure of blockchain research in the field of renewable finance
   from November 1, 2008 to January 31, 2022, this paper proposes a
   multi-level and all-round comprehensive bibliometric method
   (Co-occurrence Analysis method, Natural Language Pro-cessing method, and
   Exploratory Factor Analysis method) to comprehend the mode, process, and
   mechanism of the integration of them. The findings indicate that: (1)
   Blockchain has been widely used in many industries involved in
   sustainable finance; (2) Blockchain will have a long-term impact on
   Sustainable Finance in the fields of smart city and sharing economy; (3)
   Blockchain can be deeply integrated with other technologies to promote
   the diversified development of sustainable finance. Additionally, we
   highlight trends and research directions regarding block -chain in
   sustainable finance research.},

Abstract = {This study aims to test financial literacy and credit conditions in
   determining formal credit access to determine the performance of MSMEs.
   This research includes the type of associative research that is
   accompanied by hypothesis testing. This research was conducted on MSMEs
   of as many as 324 creative industry players in four cities in East Java
   (Mojokerto, Pasuruan, Gresik, and Sidoarjo) with a sample size of 100
   actors who had accessed formal credit using the stratified random
   sampling method for data collection. The results of Smart PLS analysis
   show that financial literacy and credit terms directly and significantly
   affect access to formal credit and MSME performance; formal credit
   access directly and significantly affects MSME performance. Likewise,
   financial literacy and credit terms indirectly affect the performance of
   MSMEs. These results mean that financial literacy and credit terms have
   a strategic role in explaining why access to formal credit is growing
   and is attracting MSMEs to strengthen capital to improve performance.},

Abstract = {Research background: The direction of the tourism industry towards
   digital change is a particularly hot topic of many discussions.
   Especially during the pandemic, the initiatives started to be
   strengthened for the accelerated development of digital elements that
   will be able to support the tourism industry, especially in the
   post-pandemic period. Destination try to refresh their action by using
   several digital marketing tool to attract tourist after so difficult
   period.
   Purpose of the article: The purpose of the contribution is to bring
   closer the perception and use of digital information as a means of
   digital marketing as well as the digital offer itself as a way of
   sustainability of the chosen tourism destination, using the example of
   the town of Presov in the Slovak Republic. The conducted research
   investigates the behaviour of the modern digital tourist with regard to
   the digital offer provided to him through modern technologies.
   Methods: Digitally oriented research was based on author's questionnaire
   research, the results of which were evaluated using several methods. As
   the main methods of evaluating the research result were Kruskal-Wallis
   and Chi-square test.
   Findings \& Value added: The results of the conducted research showed
   that digital information plays a dominant role in information in the
   tourism industry. Its participants are moving towards transformations
   and to a profile of distinctly digital tourist. It relies on modern
   technologies and therefore it is essential that individual tourist
   destinations also adapt to this digital trend and develop digital
   services for the benefit of future sustainability.},

Abstract = {MSME sector faces a number of marketing, infrastructural, financial and
   other constraints and challenges which put hindrance on the way to
   achieve a faster growth of this sector. Among the other constraints,
   lack of access to sufficient financing especially in developing
   countries, has been identified as a major bottleneck in realising the
   potential of this sector. Odisha is one of the top ten States in
   creation of job (20,839 person in 2006-07 and 107,011 in 2014-15) by
   MSMEsector although it is positioned at 11 in respect of number of MSME
   units set up as compared to other States. Credit flow to the MSME sector
   declined during recent period in the state (41\%) as against an
   increasing trend in the country (48\%) (RBI Report 2015). This brought
   to the forefront to study about the demand side issues for accessing
   institutional finance by MSME because of banks are reluctant to provide
   credit to this sector. The study is conducted in Bhubaneswar city (No 1
   smart city in India) of Odisha and chosen two clusters through cluster
   sampling technique. The total of 60 enterprises has been drawn randomly
   for the demand side analysis. To collect the data Personal interview
   method is used by taking semi structured questionnaire schedule for
   sample entrepreneurs. Factor analysis with rotate varimax normalization
   method is used to find out the major constraints faced by the MSMEs and
   to rank their problem, is presented through an index. It identified six
   major factors among its interest rate is the number one constraint in
   the demand side which impedes the growth of MSMEs not only is the
   financial problem but also in addition to that competition from
   well-running firm and lack of Labour are the major problem faced by the
   sample entrepreneurs. The results plot that manufacturing sector rife
   with more financial issues.},

Abstract = {Construction process is the broad mechanism for the realization of human
   settlements and the creation of infrastructure that supports
   development. This includes the extraction and beneficiation of raw
   materials, the manufacturing of construction materials and components,
   the construction project cycle from feasibility to deconstruction, and
   the management and operation of the built environment In Greece, the
   complex problems shared by cities are evidence of the impacts of urban
   sprawl. This research aims to investigate the sustainability components
   affecting decisions for green building projects. The research method is
   based on a questionnaire survey of thirty two participants who asked to
   assess nine sustainability components namely: Life cycle assessment,
   energy efficiency and renewable energy, water efficiency,
   environmentally preferable building materials and specifications, waste
   reduction, toxics reduction, indoor air quality, smart growth and
   sustainable development and environmentally innovative projects, which
   affect the decisions for green building projects. The respondent results
   indicate how participants prioritized the sustainability components
   ensuring a better quality of life inside buildings based on the
   principals of ``green{''} buildings economy. Energy efficiency and
   renewable energy is considered of high priority followed by the
   reduction of toxic materials, indoor pollution and water saving. (C)

Title = {Cryptocurrency as an Investment: The Malaysian Context},
Journal = {RISKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cryptocurrency is gaining popularity worldwide, with some countries
   already starting to regulate and accept cryptocurrency in their
   financial services. Malaysia's Securities Commission (SC) announced in
   October 2021 that over MYR 16 billion (USD 3.85 billion) involving
   digital assets and cryptocurrencies were traded between August 2020 and
   September 2021. Since cryptocurrencies are issued by private
   corporations and are technically beyond the federal government's
   control, criminals may use them for illegal reasons such as money
   laundering and terrorist funding. Consequently, it is vital to examine
   why investors are engaged in cryptocurrency in the first place. This
   study aims to provide insight into Malaysian investors' perceptions by
   evaluating the influence of perceived risk and perceived value on their
   cryptocurrency adoption decision. The retail investors' demographic
   characteristics (gender, age, education, income, and investment
   experience) were analyzed as control variables. Data were gathered using
   purposive sampling, and responses from 211 respondents from various
   cities in Malaysia were used in the final analysis. Data were examined
   using Smart PLS Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). Based on the
   finding's, perceived value was found to have a significant influence on
   cryptocurrency adoption. Meanwhile, perceived risk had no significant
   influence on the adoption of cryptocurrency among the Malaysian
   investors.},

Abstract = {As the UAV industry develops rapidly, UAVs are seeing wider application.
   They have the potential to play a crucial role in future smart cities
   and bring in enormous economic benefits. Presently, the battery life of
   UAVs is short and it is difficult to make breakthroughs in the short
   term. In addition, the requirements for UAV battery life get higher and
   higher. Under this situation, to deploy autonomous charging stations for
   UAVs becomes an inevitable trend. However, it remains a challenge to
   minimize the deployment cost due to various factors involved.
   Against the backdrop of taking the lead in putting forward the planning
   and layout of UAV charging station, this paper carried out the cost
   modeling of various factors affecting the cost in the charging process
   of the initial station and the later UAVs. Moreover, this paper used the
   weighted Voronoi diagram to introduce the influence of real
   environmental factors on the layout planning of charging station, flight
   route and working efficiency, thus quantifying the cost of the space
   environment. Finally, the comprehensive cost model was established and
   the optimal location of UAV charging station was selected by iterative
   optimization calculation based on genetic algorithm.
   Additionally, the paper selected the practical examples, assigned the
   parameters reasonably, solved the self-built model using the genetic
   algorithm, adjusted the iteration times and the corresponding parameters
   of the algorithm and obtained the optimization results finally.
   Therefore, applicability of the model as well as feasibility and
   optimality of the algorithm were verified.
   Under the condition of modifying and optimizing the parameters and
   corresponding values of the model in this paper, the calculation process
   of genetic algorithm was adjusted appropriately. The models and methods
   in this paper could be applied to the planning of UAV charging stations
   in the future under the actual comprehensive situation of cities or
   other regions, which maximizes some of the economic benefits in the
   field of UAV applications and the coincidence with the actual situation.},

Abstract = {Purpose Considering the importance of current Libyan business
   environment, this paper aims to understand the influence of culture on
   perceived service quality that leads to customer satisfaction in the
   Libyan banking industry. In addition, it would be interesting to explore
   which type of banks, e.g. public or private banks, moderate the
   relationship between perceived service quality and customer
   satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from
   the customers who are receiving services from the top three private and
   top three public banks in the cities of Tripoli and Misurata, Libya.
   About 329 samples were obtained and Smart PLS was used for the
   statistical analysis. Findings The results show that perceived service
   quality is strongly predicted by collectivism, masculinity and
   uncertainty avoidance. Perceived service quality also leads to customer
   satisfaction among the Libyan banking customers. Further, public bank is
   more concerned on customer satisfaction compared to private banks.
   Practical implication The research has greater implication for the
   Middle-Eastern bank managers who are pursuing possibilities of newer
   business strategies. Originality The study provides an interesting
   viewpoint of the banking service in Libya, especially in the economic
   uncertainty post-war and political instability. Its focus on culture as
   a strong influence to the delivery of service quality in such context is
   admirable especially in relation with the embedded Islamic culture.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was identifying factors that encourage
   property tax payment among property owners, specifically from the
   residential property segment within the Malaysian context. This aim is
   derived from existing evidence which clearly indicates a steady annual
   increase in property tax arrears from non-complying property owners as
   reported by the local governments (LGs). Design/methodology/approach
   This research was conducted using a survey method where a questionnaire
   was used as the research instrument in garnering the necessary study
   data. The collected data was analyzed through quantitative means towards
   gleaning study findings to fulfil the set objectives. The analyses used
   within this study were reliability analysis, descriptive analysis and
   factor analysis. Findings Research findings indicate that there are five
   factors that encourage property tax payment, namely, the proactive
   action capability of LGs; stimulation of payment; quality of staff and
   service; reliable tax foundation and governance; and smart expenditure.
   The identification of these factors has the potential to act as a
   mitigation mechanism for LGs to alleviate the issue of property tax
   arrears. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study
   may be used by LGs in developing a comprehensive action plan to
   encourage property owners to pay taxes. The study findings are
   exploratory in nature, based on the locality of the LG selected in this
   study, the Penang Island City Council (MBPP). As such, the findings may
   not be considered as a generalization of the property tax situation
   throughout Malaysia as study data was only collected from the
   administrative region of MBPP. However, these findings can still be used
   as a basis in establishing similar studies within other LGs which
   demonstrate similar characteristics with MBPP. Originality/value In the
   Malaysian scenario, the focus of the previous studies on property tax
   arrears revolves around actions that have been taken by LGs to encourage
   the payment of property tax. However, in this study, the determination
   of encouraging factors is no longer referred to LG perspectives but was
   investigated from the taxpayer dimension. This approach allows new
   mitigating ideas to be developed and adds value in the context of a
   different perspective towards establishing a more practicable action
   plan in reducing property tax arrears.},
